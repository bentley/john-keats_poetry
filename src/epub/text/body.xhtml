			<p>THE POEMS OF 1818⁠–⁠1819 ISABELLA, OR THE POT OF BASIL</p>
			<p>A STORY FROM BOCCACCIO</p>
			<p>Faik Isabel, poor simple Isabel!</p>
			<p>Lorenzo, a young palmer in love’s eye ! They could not in the self-same mansion dwell</p>
			<p>Without some stir of heart, some malady; They could not sit at meals but feel how well</p>
			<p>It soothed each to be the other by ; They could not, sure, beneath the same roof sleep But to each other dream, and nightly weep.</p>
			<p>With every morn their love grew tenderer, With every eve deeper and tenderer still;</p>
			<p>He might not in house, field, or garden stir, But her full shape would all his seeing fill;</p>
			<p>And his continual voice was pleasanter To her, than noise of trees or hidden rill;</p>
			<p>Her lute-string gave an echo of his name.</p>
			<p>She spoilt her half-done broidery with the same.</p>
			<p>He knew whose gentle hand was at the latch, Before the door had given her to his eyes ;</p>
			<p>And from her chamber-window he would catch Her beauty farther than the falcon spies;</p>
			<p>And constant as her vespers would he watch, Because her face was turn’d to the same skies</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-193"/>
			<p>ISABELLA, OR THE POT OF BASIL 193</p>
			<p>And with sick longing all the night outwear, To hear her morning-step upon the stair.</p>
			<p>A whole long month of May in this sad plight Made their cheeks paler by the break of June</p>
			<p>* To-morrow will I bow to my delight,</p>
			<p>To-morrow will I ask my lady’s boon.’⁠—</p>
			<p>* O may I never see another night,</p>
			<p>Lorenzo, if thy lips breathe not love’s tune.’ -So spake they to their pillows ; but, alas, Honeyless days and days did he let pass ;</p>
			<p>V</p>
			<p>Until sweet Isabella’s untouch’d cheek Fell sick within the rose’s just domain,</p>
			<p>Fell thin as a young mother’s, who doth seek By every lull to cool her infant’s pain:</p>
			<p>‘ How ill she is !’ said he, ‘ I may not speak, And yet I will, and tell my love all plain :</p>
			<p>If looks,speak love-laws, I will drink her tears,</p>
			<p>And at the least’t will startle off her cares.</p>
			<p>So said he one fair morning, and all day</p>
			<p>His heart beat awfully against his side ; And to his heart he inwardly did pray</p>
			<p>For power to speak ; but still the ruddy tide Stifled his voice, and pulsed resolve away⁠—Fever’d his high conceit of such a bride, Yet brought him to the meekness of a child: Alas! when passion is both meek and wild !</p>
			<p>So once more he had waked and anguished A dreary night of love and misery,</p>
			<p>If Isabel’s quick eye had not been wed To every symbol on his forehead high :</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-194"/>
			<p>She saw it waxing very pale and dead,</p>
			<p>And straight all flush’d ; so, lisped tenderly, * Lorenzo !’⁠—here she ceased her timid quest, But in her tone and look he read the rest.</p>
			<p>VIII</p>
			<p>‘ O Isabella, I can half perceive That I may speak my grief into thine ear;</p>
			<p>If thou didst ever anything believe. Believe how I love thee, believe how near</p>
			<p>My soul is to its doom: I would not grieve Thy hand by unwelcome pressing, would not fear</p>
			<p>Thine eyes by gazing ; but I cannot live</p>
			<p>Another night, and not my passion shrive.</p>
			<p>‘ Love ! thou art leading me from wintry cold. Lady ! thou leadest me to summer clime,</p>
			<p>And I must taste the blossoms that unfold</p>
			<p>In its ripe warmth this gracious morning time.</p>
			<p>So said, his erewhile timid lips grew bold. And poesied with hers in dewy rhyme:</p>
			<p>Great bliss was with them, and great happiness</p>
			<p>Grew, like a lusty flower in June’s caress.</p>
			<p>Parting they seem’d to tread upon the air, Twin roses by the zephyr blown apart</p>
			<p>Only to meet again more close, and share The inward fragrance of each other’s heart.</p>
			<p>She, to her chamber gone, a ditty fair Sang, of delicious love and honey’d dart;</p>
			<p>He with light steps went up a western hill,</p>
			<p>And bade the sun farewell, and joy’d his fill.</p>
			<p>XI</p>
			<p>All close they met again, before the dusk Had taken from the stars its pleasant veil.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-195"/>
			<p>ISABELLA, OR THE POT OF BASIL 195</p>
			<p>All close they met, all eves, before the dusk Had taken from the stars its pleasant veil.</p>
			<p>Close in a bower of hyacinth and musk, Unknown of any, free from whispering tale.</p>
			<p>Ah ! better had it been forever so,</p>
			<p>Than idle ears should pleasure in their woe.</p>
			<p>Were they unhappy then ?⁠—It cannot be⁠—Too many tears for lovers have been shed,</p>
			<p>Too many sighs give we to them in fee, Too much of pity after they are dead.</p>
			<p>Too many doleful stories do we see. Whose matter in bright gold were best be read ;</p>
			<p>Except in such a page where Theseus’ spouse</p>
			<p>Over the pathless waves towards him bows.</p>
			<p>But, for the general award of love, The little sweet doth kill much bitterness ;</p>
			<p>Though Dido silent is in under-grove, And Isabella’s was a great distress.</p>
			<p>Though young Lorenzo in warm Indian clove Was not embalm’d, this truth is not the less⁠—</p>
			<p>Even bees, the little almsmen of spring-bowers,</p>
			<p>Know there is richest juice in poison-flowers.</p>
			<p>With her two brothers this fair lady dwelt, Enriched from ancestral merchandise.</p>
			<p>And for them many a weary hand did swelt In torched mines and noisy factories,</p>
			<p>And many once proud-quiver’d loins did melt</p>
			<p>In blood from stinging whip ;⁠—with hollow eyes</p>
			<p>Many all day in dazzling river stood,</p>
			<p>To take the rich-ored driftings of the flood.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-196"/>
			<p>[96 THE POEMS OF 1818⁠–⁠1819</p>
			<p>For them the Ceylon diver held his breath, And went all naked to the hungry shark ;</p>
			<p>For them his ears gush’d blood ; for them in death The seal on the cold ice with piteous bark</p>
			<p>Lay full of darts ; for them alone did seethe A thousand men in trovibles wide and dark :</p>
			<p>Half-ignorant, they turu’d an easy wheel,</p>
			<p>That set sharp racks at work, to pinch and peel.</p>
			<p>Why were they proud ? Because their marble founts Gush’d with more pride than do a wretch’s tears ?⁠—</p>
			<p>Why were they proud ? Because fair orange-mounts Were of more soft ascent than lazar stairs ?⁠—</p>
			<p>Why were they proud ? Because red-lined accounts Were richer than the songs of Grecian years ?⁠—</p>
			<p>Why were they proud ? again we ask aloud,</p>
			<p>Why in the name of Glory were they proud ?</p>
			<p>XVII</p>
			<p>Yet were these Florentines as self-retired In hungry pride and gainful cowardice,</p>
			<p>As two close Hebrews in that land inspired, Paled in and vineyarded from beggar-spies ;</p>
			<p>The hawks of ship-mast forests⁠—the untired And pannier’d mules for ducats and old lies⁠—</p>
			<p>Quick cat’s-paws on the generous stray-away⁠—</p>
			<p>Great wits in Spanish, Tuscan, and Malay.</p>
			<p>XVIII</p>
			<p>How was it these same ledger-men could spy</p>
			<p>Fair Isabella in her downy nest ? How could they find out in Lorenzo’s eye</p>
			<p>A straying from his toil ? Hot Egypt’s pest Into their vision covetous and sly!</p>
			<p>How could these money-bags see east and west ?⁠—</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-197"/>
			<p>ISABELLA, OR THE POT OF BASIL 197</p>
			<p>Yet so tliey did⁠—and every dealer fair Must see behind, as doth the hunted hare.</p>
			<p>O eloquent and famed Boccaccio!</p>
			<p>Of thee we now should ask forgiving boon, And of thy spicy myrtles as they blow,</p>
			<p>And of thy roses amorous of the moon, And of thy lilies, that do paler grow</p>
			<p>Now they can no more hear thy ghittern’s tune, For venturing syllables that ill beseem The quiet glooms of such a piteous theme.</p>
			<p>Grant thou a pardon here, and then the tale Shall move on soberly, as it is meet;</p>
			<p>There is no other crime, no mad assail To make old prose in modern rhyme more sweet:</p>
			<p>But it is done⁠—succeed the verse or fail⁠—To honour thee, and thy gone spirit greet;</p>
			<p>To stead thee as a verse in English tongue,</p>
			<p>An echo of thee in the north-wind sung.</p>
			<p>These brethren having found by many signs What love Lorenzo for their sister had.</p>
			<p>And how she loved him too, each unconfines His bitter thoughts to other, well-nigh mad</p>
			<p>That he, the servant of their trade designs. Should in their sister’s love be blithe and glad,</p>
			<p>“When ’twas their plan to coax her by degrees</p>
			<p>To some high noble and his olive-trees.</p>
			<p>XXII</p>
			<p>And many a jealous conference had they, And many times they bit their lips alone,</p>
			<p>Before they fix’d upon a surest way To make the youngster for his crime atone ;</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-198"/>
			<p>And at the last, these men of cruel clay-Cut Mercy with a sharp knife to the bone; For they resolved in some forest dim To kill Lorenzo, and there bury him.</p>
			<p>XXIII</p>
			<p>So on a pleasant morning, as he leant</p>
			<p>Into the sunrise, o’er the balustrade Of the garden-terrace, towards him they bent</p>
			<p>Their footing through the dews; and to him said, ‘ You seem there in the quiet of content,</p>
			<p>Lorenzo, and we are most loth to invade Calm speculation ; but if you are wise, Bestride your steed while cold is in the skies.</p>
			<p>* To-day we purpose, aye, this hour we mount To spur three leagues towards the Apennine;</p>
			<p>Come down, we pray thee, ere the hot sun count His dewy rosary on the eglantine.’</p>
			<p>Lorenzo, courteously as he was wont, Bow’d a fair greeting to these serpents’ whine ;</p>
			<p>And went in haste, to get in readiness.</p>
			<p>With belt, and spur, and bracing huntsman’s dress.</p>
			<p>And as he to the court-yard pass’d along, Each third step did he pause, and listen’d oft</p>
			<p>If he could hear his lady’s matin-song, Or the light whisper of her footstep soft;</p>
			<p>And as he thus over his passion hung. He heard a laugh full musical aloft;</p>
			<p>When, looking up, he saw her features bright</p>
			<p>Smile through an in-door lattice, all delight.</p>
			<p>XXVI</p>
			<p>‘ Love, Isabel!’ said he, ‘ I was in pain Lest I should miss to bid thee a good morrow :</p>
			<p/>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-199"/>
			<p>ISABELLA, OR THE POT OF BASIL 199</p>
			<p>Ah ! what if I should lose thee, when so fain</p>
			<p>I am to stifle all the heavy sorrow Of a poor three hours’ absence ? but we ’11 gain</p>
			<p>Out of the amorous dark what day doth borrow. Good bye ! I ’11 soon be back.’⁠—‘ Good bye !’ said</p>
			<p>she:⁠—And as he went she chanted merrily.</p>
			<p>XXVII</p>
			<p>So the two brothers and their murder’d man Rode past fair Florence, to where Arno’s stream</p>
			<p>Gurgles through straighten’d banks, and still doth fan Itself with dancing bulrush, and the bream</p>
			<p>Keeps head against the freshets. Sick and wan The brothers’ faces in the ford did seem,</p>
			<p>Lorenzo’s flush with love. — They pass’d the water</p>
			<p>Into a forest quiet for the slaughter.</p>
			<p>XXVIII</p>
			<p>There was Lorenzo slain and buried in, There in that forest did his great love cease;</p>
			<p>Ah ! when a soul doth thus its freedom win, It aches in loneliness⁠—is ill at peace</p>
			<p>As the break-covert bloodhounds of such sin: They dipp’d their swords in the water, and did tease</p>
			<p>Their horses homeward, with convulsed spur,</p>
			<p>Each richer by his being a murderer.</p>
			<p>They told their sister how, with sudden speed, Lorenzo had ta’en ship for foreign lands,</p>
			<p>Because of some great urgency and need In their affairs, requiring trusty hands.</p>
			<p>Poor Girl! put on thy stifling widow’s weed, And ‘scape at once from Hope’s accursed bands:</p>
			<p>To-day thou wilt not see him, nor to-morrow,</p>
			<p>And the next day will be a day of sorrow.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-200"/>
			<p>She weeps alone for pleasures not to be;</p>
			<p>Sorely she wept until the night came on, And then, instead of love, O misery 1</p>
			<p>She brooded o’er the luxury alone : His image in the dusk she seem’d to see,</p>
			<p>And to the silence made a gentle moan. Spreading her perfect arms upon the air, And on her couch low murmuring, ‘ Where ? O where ?’</p>
			<p>But Selfishness, Love’s cousin, held not long Its fiery vigil in her single breast;</p>
			<p>She fretted for the golden hour, and hung Upon the time with feverish unrest⁠—</p>
			<p>Not long⁠—for soon into her heart a throng Of higher occupants, a richer zest.</p>
			<p>Came tragic ; passion not to be subdued,</p>
			<p>And sorrow for her love in travels rude.</p>
			<p>XXXII</p>
			<p>In the mid days of autumn, on their eves The breath of Winter comes from far away,</p>
			<p>And the sick west continually bereaves Of some gold tinge, and plays a roundelay</p>
			<p>Of death among the bushes and the leaves, To make all bare before he dares to stray</p>
			<p>From his north cavern. So sweet Isabel</p>
			<p>By gradual decay from beauty fell,</p>
			<p>Because Lorenzo came not. Oftentimes She ask’d her brothers, with an eye all pale.</p>
			<p>Striving to be itself, what dungeon climes Could keep him off so long ? They spake a tale</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-201"/>
			<p>ISABELLA, OR THE POT OF BASIL 201</p>
			<p>Time after time, to quiet her. Their crimes</p>
			<p>Came on them, like a smoke from Hinnom’s vale; And every night in dreams they groan’d aloud, To see their sister in her snowy shroud.</p>
			<p>And she had died in drowsy ignorance. But for a thing more deadly dark than all;</p>
			<p>It came like a fierce potion, drunk by chance, Which saves a sick man from the feather’d pall</p>
			<p>For some few gasping moments ; like a lance, Waking an Indian from his cloudy hall</p>
			<p>With cruel pierce, and bringing him again</p>
			<p>Sense of the gnawing fire at heart and brain.</p>
			<p>It was a vision. — In the drowsy gloom. The dull of midnight, at her couch’s foot</p>
			<p>Lorenzo stood, and wept: the forest tomb Had marr’d his glossy hair which once could shoot</p>
			<p>Lustre into the sun, and put cold doom Upon his lips, and taken the soft lute</p>
			<p>From his lorn voice, and past his loamed ears</p>
			<p>Had made a miry channel for his tears.</p>
			<p>Strange sound it was, when the pale shadow spake For there was striving, in its piteous tongue,</p>
			<p>To speak as when on earth it was awake, And Isabella on its music hung :</p>
			<p>Languor there was in it, and tremulous shake, As in a palsied Druid’s harp unstrung ;</p>
			<p>And through it moan’d a ghostly undersong,</p>
			<p>Like hoarse night-gusts sepulchral briars among.</p>
			<p>xxxvii</p>
			<p>Its eyes, though wild, were still all dewy bright With love, and kept all phantom fear aloof</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-202"/>
			<p>From the poor girl by magic of their light, The while it did unthread the horrid woof</p>
			<p>Of the late darken’d time⁠—the murderous spite Of pride and avarice⁠—the dark pine roof</p>
			<p>In the forest⁠—and the sodden turfed dell,</p>
			<p>Where, without any word, from stabs he fell.</p>
			<p>Saying moreover, ‘ Isabel, my sweet !</p>
			<p>Red whortleberries droop above my head, And a large flint-stone weighs upon my feet;</p>
			<p>Around me beeches and high chestnuts shed Their leaves and prickly nuts ; a sheepfold bleat</p>
			<p>Comes from beyond the river to my bed : Go, shed one tear upon my heather-bloom, And it shall comfort me within the tomb.</p>
			<p>‘ I am a shadow now, alas ! alas !</p>
			<p>Upon the skirts of human nature dwelling Alone : I chant alone the holy mass,</p>
			<p>While little sounds of life are round me knelling. And glossy bees at noon do fieldward pass,</p>
			<p>And many a chapel bell the hour is telling, Paining me through : those sounds grow strange to</p>
			<p>me. And thou art distant in Humanity.</p>
			<p>XL</p>
			<p>* I know what was, I feel full well what is. And I should rage, if spirits could go mad ;</p>
			<p>Though I forget the taste of earthly bliss, That paleness warms my grave, as though I had</p>
			<p>A Seraph chosen from the bright abyss To be my spouse : thy paleness makes me glad ;</p>
			<p>Thy beauty grows upon me, and I feel</p>
			<p>A greater love through all my essence steal.’</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-203"/>
			<p>ISABELLA, OR THE POT OF BASIL 203</p>
			<p>The Spirit mourn’d ‘ Adieu !’⁠—dissolved, and left The atom darkness in a slow turmoil ;</p>
			<p>As when of healthful midnight sleep bereft, Thinking on rugged hours and fruitless toil,</p>
			<p>We put our eyes into a pillowy cleft,</p>
			<p>And see the spangly gloom froth up and boil:</p>
			<p>It made sad Isabella’s eyelids ache,</p>
			<p>And in the dawn she started up awake.</p>
			<p>XLII</p>
			<p>‘ Ha ! ha !’ said she, ‘ I knew not this’hard life, I thought the worst was simple misery ;</p>
			<p>I thought some Fate with pleasure or with strife Portion’d us⁠—happy days, or else to die ;</p>
			<p>But there is crime⁠—a brother’s bloody knife ! Sweet Spirit, thou hast school’d my infancy :</p>
			<p>I ’11 visit thee for this, and kiss thine eyes,</p>
			<p>And greet thee morn and even in the skies.’</p>
			<p>“When the full morning came, she had devised How she might secret to the forest hie ;</p>
			<p>How she might find the clay, so dearly prized, And sing to it one latest lullaby ;</p>
			<p>How her short absence might be unsurmised. While she the inmost of the dream would try.</p>
			<p>Resolved, she took with her an aged nurse,</p>
			<p>And went into that dismal forest-hearse.</p>
			<p>See, as they creep along the river side, ■ How she doth whisper to that aged Dame,</p>
			<p>And, after looking round the champaign wide. Shows her a knife. — ‘ What feverous hectic flame</p>
			<p>Burns in thee, child ?⁠—what good can thee betide. That thou shouldst smile again ?’⁠—The evening</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-204"/>
			<p>And they had found Lorenzo’s earthy bed ; The flint was there, the berries at his head.</p>
			<p>Who hath not loiter’d in a green churchyard, And let his spirit, like a demon-mole,</p>
			<p>Work through the clayey soil and gravel hard. To see skull, coflSn’d bones, and funeral stole ;</p>
			<p>Pitying each form that hungry Death hath marr’d, And filling it once more with human soul ?</p>
			<p>Ah ! this is holiday to what was felt</p>
			<p>When Isabella by Lorenzo knelt.</p>
			<p>XLVI</p>
			<p>She gazed into the fresh-thrown mould, as though One glance did fully all its secrets tell;</p>
			<p>Clearly she saw, as other eyes would know Pale limbs at bottom of a crystal well;</p>
			<p>Upon the murderous spot she seem’d to grow, Like to a native lily of the dell:</p>
			<p>Then with her knife, all sudden, she began</p>
			<p>To dig more fervently than misers can.</p>
			<p>Soon she turn’d up a soiled glove, whereon Her silk had play’d in purple phantasies:</p>
			<p>She kiss’d it with a lip more chill than stone, And put it in her bosom, where it dries</p>
			<p>And freezes utterly unto the bone</p>
			<p>Those dainties made to still an infant’s cries ;</p>
			<p>Then ‘gan she work again ; nor stay’d her care,</p>
			<p>But to throw back at times her veiling hair.</p>
			<p>That old nurse stood beside her wondering, Until her heart felt pity to the core</p>
			<p>At sight of such a dismal labouring. And so she kneeled, with her locks all hoar,</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-205"/>
			<p>OR THE POT OF BASIL 205</p>
			<p>And put her lean hands to the horrid thing:</p>
			<p>Three hours they labour’d at this travail sore: At last they felt the kernel of the grave, And Isabella did not stamp and rave.</p>
			<p>Ah! wherefore all this wormy circumstance ?</p>
			<p>Why linger at the yawning tomb so long ? O for the gentleness of old Romance,</p>
			<p>The simple plaining of a minstrel’s song ! Fair reader, at the old tale take a glance,</p>
			<p>For here, in truth, it doth not well belong To speak :⁠—O turn thee to the very tale. And taste the music of that vision pale.</p>
			<p>L</p>
			<p>With duller steel than the Persean sword They cut away no formless monster’s head,</p>
			<p>But one, whose gentleness did well accord</p>
			<p>With death, as life. The ancient harps have said.</p>
			<p>Love never dies, but lives, immortal Lord: If Love impersonate was ever dead.</p>
			<p>Pale Isabella kiss’d it, and low moan’d.</p>
			<p>‘T was love ; cold⁠—dead indeed, but not dethron’d.</p>
			<p>In anxious secrecy they took it home, And then the prize was all for Isabel:</p>
			<p>She calm’d its wild hair with a golden comb, And all around each eye’s sepulchral cell</p>
			<p>Pointed each fringed lash ; the smeared loam With tears, as chilly as a dripping well.</p>
			<p>She drench’d away : and still she comb’d, and kept</p>
			<p>Sighing all day⁠—and still she kiss’d and wept.</p>
			<p>Then in a silken scarf⁠—sweet with the dews Of precious flowers pluck’d in Araby,</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-206"/>
			<p>And divine liquids come with odorous ooze Through the cold serpent-pipe refreshfully⁠—</p>
			<p>She wrapp’d it up ; and for its tomb did choose A garden-pot, wherein she laid it by,</p>
			<p>And cover’d it with mould, and o’er it set</p>
			<p>Sweet Basil, which her tears kept ever wet.</p>
			<p>LIII</p>
			<p>And she forgot the stars, the moon, and sun, And she forgot the blue above the trees,</p>
			<p>And she forgot the dells where waters run, And she forgot the chilly autumn breeze ;</p>
			<p>She had no knowledge when the day was done, And the new morn she saw not: but in peace</p>
			<p>Hung over her sweet Basil evermore.</p>
			<p>And moisten’d it with tears unto the core.</p>
			<p>And so she ever fed it with thin tears. Whence thick, and green, and beautiful it grew.</p>
			<p>So that it smelt more balmy than its peers Of Basil-tufts in Florence ; for it drew</p>
			<p>Nurture besides, and life, from human fears. From the fast mouldering head there shut from view :</p>
			<p>So that the jewel, safely casketed, ■</p>
			<p>Came forth, and in perfumed leafits spread.</p>
			<p>O Melancholy, linger here awhile!</p>
			<p>O Music, Music, breathe despondingly ! O Echo, Echo, from some sombre isle.</p>
			<p>Unknown, Lethean, sigh to us⁠—O sigh ! Spirits in grief, lift up your heads, and smile ;</p>
			<p>Lift up your heads, sweet Spirits, heavily, And make a pale light in your cypress glooms. Tinting with silver wan your marble tombs.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-207"/>
			<p>ISABELLA, OR THE POT OF BASIL 207</p>
			<p>LVI</p>
			<p>Moan hither, all ye syllables of woe, From the deep throat of sad Melpomene !</p>
			<p>Through bronzed lyre in tragic order go. And touch the strings into a mystery ;</p>
			<p>Sound mournfully upon the winds and low ; For simple Isabel is soon to be</p>
			<p>Among the dead: She withers, like a palm</p>
			<p>Cut by an Indian for its juicy balm.</p>
			<p>O leave the palm to wither by itself;</p>
			<p>Let not quick Winter chill its dying hour !⁠—It may not be⁠—those Baalites of pelf.</p>
			<p>Her brethren, noted the continual shower From her dead eyes: and many a curious elf.</p>
			<p>Among her kindred, wonder’d that such dower Of youth and beauty should be thrown aside By one mark’d out to be a Noble’s bride.</p>
			<p>And, furthermore, her brethren wonder’d much Why she sat drooping by the Basil green.</p>
			<p>And why it flourish’d, as by magic touch ;</p>
			<p>Greatly they wonder’d what the thing might mean :</p>
			<p>They could not surely give belief, that such A very nothing would have power to wean</p>
			<p>Her from her own fair youth, and pleasures gay,</p>
			<p>And even remembrance of her love’s delay.</p>

			<p>For seldom did she go to chapel-shrift, And seldom felt she any hunger-pain :</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-208"/>
			<p>And when she left, she hurried back, as swift</p>
			<p>As bird on wing to breast its eggs again: And, patient as a hen-bird, sat her there Beside her Basil, weeping through her hair.</p>
			<p>Yet they contrived to steal the Basil-pot, And to examine it in secret place :</p>
			<p>The thing was vile with green and livid spot, And yet they knew it was Lorenzo’s face :</p>
			<p>The guerdon of their murder they had got, And so left Florence in a moment’s space,</p>
			<p>Never to turn again. — Away they went.</p>
			<p>With blood upon their heads, to banishment.</p>

			<p>For Isabel, sweet Isabel, will die ; Will die a death too lone and incomplete, Now they have ta’en away her Basil sweet.</p>
			<p>LXII</p>
			<p>Piteous she look’d on dead and senseless things, Asking for her lost Basil amorously :</p>
			<p>And with melodious chuckle in the strings Of her lorn voice, she oftentimes would cry</p>
			<p>After the Pilgrim in his wanderings. To ask him where her Basil was ; and why</p>
			<p>‘T was hid from her : ‘ For cruel ‘t is,’ said she,</p>
			<p>‘ To steal my Basil-pot away from me.’</p>
			<p>And so she pined, and so she died forlorn. Imploring for her Basil to the last.</p>

			<p>No leaf doth tremble, no ripple is there</p>
			<p>On the river⁠—all’s still, and the night’s sleepy eye Closes up, and forgets all its Lethean care, Charm’d to death by the drone of the humming May-fly; And the Moon, whether prudish or complaisant. Has fled to her bower, well knowing I want No light in the dusk, no torch in the gloom, But my Isabel’s eyes, and her lips pulp’d with bloom.</p>

Golden aisled, built up in heaven, Gazed at such a rugged wonder. As I stood its roofing under. Lo ! I saw one sleeping there, On the marble cold and bare ; While the surges wash’d his feet. And his garments white did beat Drench’d about the sombre rocks ; On his neck his well-grown locks. Lifted dry above the main. Were upon the curl again. ‘ What is this ? and what art thou ?’ Whisper’d I, and touch’d his brow ; ‘ What art thou ? and what is this ?’ Whisper’d I, and strove to kiss The spirit’s hand, to wake his eyes ; Up he started in a trice : * I am Lycidas,’ said he, ‘ Famed in funeral minstrelsy !

			<p>TRANSLATION FROM A SONNET OF RONSARD</p>
			<p>Nature withheld Cassandra in the skies,</p>
			<p>For more adornment, a full thousand years ; She took their cream of Beauty’s fairest dyes,</p>
			<p>And shaped and tinted her above all Peers : Meanwhile Love kept her dearly with his wings,</p>
			<p>And underneath their shadow fill’d her eyes With such a richness that the cloudy Kings</p>
			<p>Of high Olympus utter’d slavish sighs. When from the Heavens I saw her first descend,</p>
			<p>My heart took fire, and only burning pains, They were my pleasures⁠—they my Life’s sad end ;</p>
			<p>Love pour’d her beauty into my warm veins.</p>
			<p>TO A LADY SEEN FOR A FEW MOMENTS AT VAUXHALL</p>
			<p>Time’s sea hath been five years at its slow ebb.</p>
			<p>Long hours have to and fro let creep the sand, Since I was tangled in thy beauty’s web.</p>
			<p>And snared by the ungloving of thine hand. And yet I never look on midnight sky,</p>
			<p>But I behold thine eyes’ well-memoried light; I cannot look upon the rose’s dye,</p>
			<p>But to thy cheek my soul doth take its flight; I cannot look on any budding flower,</p>
			<p>But my fond ear, in fancy at thy lips And hearkening for a love-sound, doth devour</p>

			<p>You lived alone in the forest-tree,</p>

			<p>THE EVE OF ST. AGNES</p>
			<p>St. Agnes’ Eve⁠—Ah, bitter chill it was ! The owl, for all his feathers, was a-cold ; The hare limp’d trembling through the frozen grass. And silent was the flock in woolly fold: Numb were the Beadsman’s fingers, while he told His rosary, and while his frosted breath. Like pious incense from a censer old, Seem’d taking flight for heaven, without a death. Past the sweet Virgin’s picture, while his prayer he saith,</p>
			<p>II</p>
			<p>His prayer he saith, this patient, holy man ; Then takes his lamp, and riseth from his knees, And back returneth, meagre, barefoot, wan Along the chapel aisle by slow degrees : The sculptured dead, on each side, seem to freeze, Emprison’d in black, purgatorial rails : Knights, ladies, praying in dumb orat’ries, He passeth by ; and his weak spirit fails To think how they may ache in icy hoods and mails.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-222"/>
			<p>Northward he turneth through a little door, And scarce three steps, ere Music’s golden tongue Flatter’d to tears this aged man and poor ; But no⁠—already had his death-bell rung; The j oys of all his life were said and sung: His was harsh penance on St. Agnes’ Eve : Another way he went, and soon among Rough ashes sat he for his soul’s reprieve, And all night kept awake, for sinners’ sake to grieve.</p>
			<p>That ancient Beadsman heard the prelude soft; And so it chanced, for many a door was wide, From hurry to and fro. Soon, up aloft. The silver, snarling trumpets ‘gan to chide : The level chambers, ready with their pride, Were glowing to receive a thousand guests: The carved angels, ever eager-eyed. Stared, where upon their heads the cornice rests, With hair blown back, and wings put crosswise on their breasts.</p>
			<p>At length burst in the argent revelry,</p>
			<p>With plume, tiara, and all rich array.</p>
			<p>Numerous as shadows haunting fairily</p>
			<p>The brain, new-stuff’d, in youth, with triump? s</p>
			<p>gay Of old romance. These let us wish away. And turn, sole-thoughted, to one Lady there. Whose heart had brooded, all that wintry day, On love, and wing’d St. Agnes’ saintly care. As she had heard old dames full many times declare.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-223"/>
			<p>VI</p>
			<p>They told her how, upon St. Agnes’ Eve, Young virgins might have visions of delight, And soft adorings from their loves receive Upon the honey’d middle of the night, If ceremonies due they did aright; As, supperless to bed they must retire. And couch supine their beauties, lily white; Nor look behind, nor sideways, but require Of Heaven with upward eyes for all that they desire.</p>
			<p>VII</p>
			<p>Full of this whim was thoughtful Madeline : The music, yearning like a God in pain. She scarcely heard : her maiden eyes divine, Fix’d on the floor, saw many a sweeping train Pass by⁠—she heeded not at all: in vain Came many a tiptoe, amorous cavalier, And back retired ; not cool’d by high disdain, But she saw not: her heart was otherwhere ; She sigh’d for Agnes’ dreams, the sweetest of the year.</p>
			<p>VIII</p>
			<p>She danced along with vague, regardless eyes, Anxious her lips, her breathing quick and short: The hallow’d hour was near at hand : she sighs Amid the timbrels, and the throng’d resort Of whisperers in anger, or in sport; ‘Mid looks of love, defiance, hate, and scorn, Hoodwink’d with faery fancy ; all amort. Save to St. Agnes and her lambs unshorn. And all the bliss to be before to-morrow morn.</p>
			<p>IX</p>
			<p>So, purposing each moment to retire,</p>
			<p>She linger’d still. Meantime, across the moors,</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-224"/>
			<p>Had come young Porphyro, with heart on fire For Madeline. Beside the portal doors, Buttress’d from moonlight, stands he, and implores All saints to give him sight of Madeline, But for one moment in the tedious hours, That he might gaze and worship all unseen ; Perchance speak, kneel, touch, kiss⁠—in sooth such things have been.</p>
			<p>He ventures in : let no buzz’d whisper tell: All eyes be muffled, or a hundred swords Will storm his heart. Love’s fev’rous citadel: For him, those chambers held barbarian hordes. Hyena foemen, and hot-blooded lords. Whose very dogs would execrations howl Against his lineage: not one breast affords Him any mercy, in that mansion foul. Save one old beldame, weak in body and in soul.</p>
			<p>Ah, happy chance ! the aged creature came. Shuffling along with ivory-headed wand, To where he stood, hid from the torch’s flame, Behind a broad hall-pillar, far beyond The sound of merriment and chorus bland: He startled her ; but soon she knew his face, And grasp’d his fingers in her palsied hand. Saying, ‘ Mercy, Porphyro 1 hie thee from this</p>
			<p>place ; They are all here to-night, the whole bloodthirsty</p>
			<p>race!</p>
			<p>XII</p>
			<p>* Get hence! get hence ! there ‘s dwarfish Hilde-</p>

			<p>here; Follow me, child, or else these stones will be thy</p>
			<p>bier.’</p>
			<p>XIII</p>
			<p>He follow’d through a lowly arched way,</p>
			<p>^ Brushing the cobwebs with his lofty plume ;</p>
			<p>- And as she mutter’d ‘ Well-a⁠—well-a-day !’</p>
			<p>He found him in a little moonlight room,</p>
			<p>Pale, latticed, chill, and silent as a tomb.</p>
			<p>* Now tell me where is Madeline,’ said he,</p>
			<p>* O tell me, Angela, by the holy loom Which none but secret sisterhood may see,</p>
			<p>When they St. Agnes’ wool are weaving piously.*</p>
			<p>* St. Agnes! Ah! it is St. Agnes’ Eve⁠—Yet men will murder upon holy days : Thou must hold water in a witch’s sieve. And be liege-lord of all the Elves and Fays, To venture so: it fills me with amaze To see thee, Porphyro!⁠—St. Agnes’ Eve! God’s help! my lady fair the conjurer plays This very night: good angels her deceive! But let me laugh awhile, I’ve mickle time to grieve.’</p>
			<p>XV</p>
			<p>Feebly she laugheth in the languid moon, While Porphyro upon her face doth look. Like puzzled urchin on an aged crone Who keepeth closed a v/ond’rous riddle-book, As spectacled she sits in chimney nook.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-226"/>
			<p>But soon his eyes grew brilliant, when she told His lady’s purpose ; and he scarce could brook Tears, at the thought of those enchantments cold, And Madeline asleep in lap of legends old.</p>
			<p>Sudden a thought came like a full-blown roSe, Flushing his brow, and in his pained heart Made purple riot: then doth he propose A stratagem, that makes the beldame start: ‘ A cruel man and impious thou art: Sweet lady, let her pray, and sleep, and dream Alone with her good angels, far apart From wicked men like thee. Go, go ! I deem Thou canst not surely be the same that thou didst seem.’</p>
			<p>‘ I will not harm her, by all saints I swear,’ Quoth Porphyro : ‘ O may I ne’er iSnd grace When my weak voice shall whisper its last prayer, If one of her soft ringlets I displace. Or look with ruffian passion in her face: Good Angela, believe me by these tears; Or I will, even in a moment’s space. Awake, with horrid shout, my foemen’s ears. And beard them, though they be more fang’d than wolves and bears.’</p>
			<p>‘ Ah ! why wilt thou affright a feeble soul ?</p>
			<p>A poor, weak, palsy-stricken, church-yard thing.</p>
			<p>Whose passing-bell may ere the midnight toll;</p>
			<p>Whose prayers for thee, each morn and evening,</p>
			<p>Were never miss’d.’ Thus plaining, doth she bring</p>
			<p>A gentler speech from burning Porphyro ;</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-227"/>
			<p>So woful, and of such deep sorrowing, That Angela gives promise she will do Whatever he shall wish, betide her weal or woe.</p>
			<p>Which was, to lead him, in close secrecy, Even to Madeline’s chamber, and there hide Him in a closet, of such privacy That he might see her beauty unespied, And win perhaps that night a peerless bride, While legion’d fairies paced the coverlet. And pale enchantment held her sleepy-eyed. Never on such a night have lovers met. Since Merlin paid his Demon all the monstrous debt.</p>
			<p>‘It shall be as thou wishest,’ said the Dame:</p>
			<p>‘ All cates and dainties shall be stored there</p>
			<p>Quickly on this feast-night: by the tambour frame</p>
			<p>Her own lute thou wilt see : no time to spare,</p>
			<p>For I am slow and feeble, and scarce dare</p>
			<p>On such a catering trust my dizzy head.</p>
			<p>Wait here, my child, with patience; kneel in</p>
			<p>prayer The while: Ah ! thou must needs the lady wed. Or may I never leave my grave among the dead.’</p>
			<p>So saying she hobbled oif with busy fear. The lover’s endless minutes slowly pass’d ; The Dame retm-n’d, and whisper’d in his ear To follow her ; with aged eyes aghast From fright of dim espial. Safe at last, Through many a dusky gallery, they gain The maiden’s chamber, silken, hush’d and chaste; Where Porphyro took covert, pleased amain. His poor guide hurried back with agues in her brain.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-228"/>
			<p>XXII</p>
			<p>Her falt’ring hand upon the balustrade, Old Angela was feeling for the stair. When Madeline, St. Agnes’ charmed maid, Rose, like a mission’d spirit, unaware : With silver taper’s light, and pious care. She turn’d, -and down the aged gossip led To a safe level matting. Now prepare. Young Porphyro, for gazing on that bed ; She comes, she comes again, like ring-dove fray’d and fled.</p>
			<p>XXIII</p>
			<p>Out went the taper as she hurried in ; Its little smoke, in pallid moonshine, died: She closed the door, she panted, all akin To spirits of the air, and visions wide : No uttered syllable, or, woe betide! But to her heart, her heart was voluble, Paining with eloquence her balmy side ; As though a tongueless nightingale should swell Her throat in vain, and die, heart-stifled in her dell.</p>
			<p>A casement high and triple arch’d there was, All garlanded with carven imag’ries Of fruits, and flowers, and bunches of knot-grass. And diamonded with panes of quaint device, Innumerable of stains and splendid dyes. As are the tiger-moth’s deep-damask’d wings; And in the midst, ‘mong thousand heraldries, And twilight saints, and dim emblazonings, A shielded scutcheon blush’d with blood of queens and kings.</p>
			<p>Full on this casement shone the wintry moon. And threw warm gules on Madeline’s fair breast.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-229"/>
			<p>As down she knelt for heaven’s grace and boon ; Rose-bloom fell on her hands, together prest, And on her silver cross soft amethyst, And on her hair a glory, like a saint: She seem’d a splendid angel, newly drest, Save wings, for heaven :⁠—Porphyro grew faint ; She knelt, so pure a thing, so free from mortal taint.</p>
			<p>XXVI</p>
			<p>Anon his heart revives: her vespers done. Of all its wreathed pearls her hair she frees ; Unclasps her warmed jewels one by one; Loosens her fragrant bodice ; by degrees Her rich attire creeps rustling to her knees: Half-hidden, like a mermaid in sea-weed. Pensive awhile she dreams awake, and sees, In fancy, fair St. Agnes in her bed, But dares not look behind, or all the charm is fled.</p>
			<p>xxvii Soon, trembling in her soft and chilly nest, In sort of wakeful swoon, perplex’d she lay, Until the poppied warmth of sleep oppress’d Her soothed limbs, and soul fatigued away ; Flown, like a thought, until the morrow-day ; Blissfully haven’d both from joy and pain ; Clasp’d like a missal where swart Paynims pray ; Blinded alike from sunshine and from rain, As though a rose should shut, and be a bud again.</p>
			<p>Stol’n to this paradise, and so entranced, Porphyro gazed upon her empty dress, And listen’d to her breathing, if it chanced To wake into a slumberous tenderness; Which when he heard, that minute did he bless, And breathed himself : then from the closet crept,</p>

			<p>’230 THE POEMS OF 1818⁠–⁠1819</p>
			<p>Noiseless as fear in a wide wilderness, And over the hush’d carpet, silent, stept, And ’tween the curtains peep’d, where, lo !⁠—how ■ fast she slept. m</p>
			<p>Then by the bed-side, where the faded moon Made a dim, silver twilight, soft he set A table, and, half-anguish’d, threw thereon A cloth of woven crimson, gold, and jet:⁠—O for some drowsy Morphean amulet! The boisterous, midnight, festive clarion, The kettle-drum, and far-heard clarionet, Affray his ears, though but in dying tone :⁠—The hall-door shuts again, and all the noise is gone.</p>
			<p>XXX</p>
			<p>And still she slept an azure-lidded sleep, In blanched linen, smooth, and lavender’d, While he from forth the closet brought a heap Of candied apple, quince, and plum, and gourd ; With jellies soother than the creamy curd, And lucent syrops, tinct with cinnamon; Manna and dates, in argosy transferr’d From Fez ; and spiced dainties, every one, From silken Samarcand to cedar’d Lebanon.</p>
			<p>XXXI</p>
			<p>These delicates he heap’d with glowing hand On golden dishes and in baskets bright Of wreathed silver : sumptuous they stand In the retired quiet of the night. Filling the chilly room with perfume light. — ‘ And now, my love, my seraph fair, awake! Thou art my heaven, and I thine eremite: Open thine eyes, for meek St. Agnes’ sake, Or I shall drowse beside thee, so my soul doth ache.’</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-231"/>
			<p>XXXII</p>
			<p>Thus whispering, his warm, unnerved arm Sank in her pillow. Shaded was her dream By the dusk cui’tains:⁠—‘t was a midnight charm Impossible to melt as iced stream : The lustrous salvers in the moonlight gleam ; Broad golden fringe upon the carpet lies : It seem’d he never, never could redeem From such a steadfast spell his lady’s eyes; So mused awhile, entoil’d in woofed phantasies.</p>
			<p>Awakening up, he took her hollow lute⁠—Tumultuous⁠—and, in chords that tenderest be, He play’d an ancient ditty, long since mute. In Provence call’d ‘ La belle dame sans mercy:’ Close to her ear touching the melody;⁠—Wherewith disturb’d, she utter’d a soft moan: He ceased⁠—she panted quick⁠—and suddenly Her blue affrayed eyes wide open shone: Upon his knees he sank, pale as smooth-sculptured stone.</p>
			<p>XXXIV</p>
			<p>Her eyes were open, but she still beheld, Now wide awake, the vision of her sleep : There was a painful change, that nigh oYpeU’d The blisses of her dream so pure and d’.ep At which fair Madeline began to weep. And moan forth witless words with many a sigh; While still her gaze on Porphyro would keep ; Who knelt, with joined hands and piteous eye. Fearing to move or speak, she look’d so Jicamingiy.</p>
			<p>XXXV</p>
			<p>* Ah, Porphyro !’ said she, ‘ but even now Thy voice was at sweet tremble in mine ear, .</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-232"/>
			<p>Made tuneable with every sweetest vow ; And those sad eyes were spiritual and clear: How changed thou art! how pallid, chill, and</p>
			<p>drear \ -Give me that voice again, my Porphyro, Those looks immortal, those complainings dear I Oh leave me not in this eternal woe. For if thou diest, my Love, I know not where to go.*</p>
			<p>XXXVI</p>
			<p>Beyond a mortal man impassion’d far At these voluptuous accents, he arose, Ethereal, flush’d, and like a throbbing star Seen mid the sapphire heaven’s deep repose ; Into her dream he melted, as the rose Blendeth its odour with the violet⁠—Solution sweet: meantime the frost-wind blows Like Love’s alarum pattering the sharp sleet Against the window-panes; St. Agnes’ moon hath set.</p>
			<p>xxxvii</p>
			<p>‘T is dark : quick pattereth the flaw-blown sleet: * This is no dream, my bride, my Madeline !’ ‘T is dark : the iced gusts still rave and beat: ‘ No dream, alas ! alas ! and woe is mine ! Porphyro will leave me here to fade and pine. — Cruel! what traitor could thee hither bring ? X curse not, for my heart is lost in thine, Though thou forsakest a deceived thing;⁠—A dove forlorn and lost with sick unpruned wing.’</p>
			<p>xxxviii My Madeline ! sweet dreamer ! lovely bride! Say, may I be for aye thy vassal blest ? Thy beauty’s shield, heart-shaped and vermeil</p>
			<p>dyed? Ah, silver shrine, here will I take my rest After so many hours of toil and quest.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-233"/>
			<p>A famish’d pilgrim⁠—saved by miracle. Though I have found, I will not rob thy nest Saving of thy sweet self ; if thou think’st well To trust, fair Madeline, to no rude infidel.</p>
			<p>‘ Hark ! ‘t is an elfin storm from faery land, Of haggard seeming, but a boon indeed : Arise⁠—arise ! the morning is at hand :⁠—The bloated wassailers will never heed :⁠—Let us away, my love, with happy speed ; There are no ears to hear, or eyes to see⁠—Drown’d all in Rhenish and the sleepy mead: Awake ! arise ! my love, and fearless be, For o’er the southern moors I have a home for thee.’</p>
			<p>She huri’ied at his words, beset with fears, For there were sleeping dragons all around. At glaring watch, perhaps, with ready spears⁠—Down the wide stairs a darkling way they</p>
			<p>found. — In all the house was heard no human sound. A chain-droop*d lamp was flickering by each door ; The arras, rich with horseman, hawk, and hound, Flutter’d in the besieging wind’s uproar ; And the long carpets rose along the gusty floor.</p>
			<p>XLI</p>
			<p>They glide, like phantoms, into the wide hall; Like phantoms to the iron porch they glide. Where lay the Porter, in uneasy sprawl, With a huge empty flagon by his side: The wakeful bloodhound rose, and shook his hide, But his sagacious eye an inmate owns: By one, and one, the bolts full easy slide :⁠—The chains lie silent on the footworn stones ;⁠—The key turns, and the door upon its hinges groans.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-234"/>
			<p>And they are gone : aye, ages long ago These lovers fled away into the storm. That night the Baron dreamt of many a woe, And all his warrior-guests, with shade and form Of witch, and demon, and large coffin-worm, “Were long be-nightmared. Angela the old Died palsy-twitch’d, with meagre face deform : The Beadsman, after thousand aves told, For aye unsought-for slept among his ashes cold.</p>

			<p>Thou still unravish’d bride of quietness,</p>
			<p>Thou foster-child of Silence and slow Time, Sylvan historian, who canst thus express</p>
			<p>A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme : What leaf-fringed legend haunts about thy shape</p>
			<p>Of deities or mortals, ‘or of both, In Tempe or the dales of Arcady ?</p>

			<p>Thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare ; Bold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss, Though winning near the goal⁠—yet, do not grieve ; She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss,</p>

			<p>For ever warm and still to be enjoy’d. For ever panting, and for ever young ; All breathing human passion far above,</p>

			<p>Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel. Is emptied of this folk, this pious morn ? And, little town, thy streets for evermore</p>
			<p>Will silent be; and not a soul to tell Why thou art desolate, can e’er return.</p>

			<p>Of marble men and maidens overwrought, With forest branches and the trodden weed ;</p>
			<p>Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought As doth eternity : Cold Pastoral!</p>
			<p>When old age shall this generation waste, Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe</p>

			<p>ODE ON INDOLENCE</p>
			<p>‘ They toil not, neither do they spin.’</p>
			<p>I</p>
			<p>One morn before me were three figiires seen,</p>
			<p>With bowed necks, and j oined hands, side-faced; And one behind the other stepp’d serene.</p>
			<p>In placid sandals, and in white robes graced ; They pass’d, like figures on a marble urn,</p>
			<p>When shifted round to see the other side ; They came again ; as when the urn once more Is shifted round, the first seen shades return;</p>
			<p>And they were strange to me, as may betide With vases, to one deep in Phidian lore.</p>
			<p>How is it, Shadows ! that I knew ye not ?</p>
			<p>How came ye mulfled in so hush a mask ? Was it a silent deep-disguised plot</p>
			<p>To steal away, and leave without a task My idle days ? Ripe was the drowsy hour ; The blissful cloud of summer-indolence Benumb’d my eyes ; my pulse grew less and less; Pain had no sting, and pleasure’s wreath no flower : O, why did ye not melt, and leave my sense Unhaunted quite of all but⁠—nothingness ?</p>
			<p>A third time pass’d they by, and, passing, turn’d Each one the face a moment whiles to me ;</p>
			<p>Then faded, and to follow them I burn’d And ached for wings, because I knew the three;</p>
			<p>The first was a fair Maid, and Love her name ;</p>
			<p>The second was Ambition, pale of cheek,</p>
			<p>And ever watchful with fatigued eye;</p>
			<p>The last, whom I love more, the more of blame</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-237"/>
			<p>Is heap’d upon her, maiden most unmeek⁠—I knew to be my demon Poesy.</p>
			<p>IV</p>
			<p>They faded, and, forsooth 1 I wanted wings:</p>
			<p>O folly ! What is Love ? and where is it ? And for that poor Ambition ! it springs</p>
			<p>From a man’s little heart’s short fever-fit; For Poesy !⁠—no⁠—she has not a joy⁠—</p>
			<p>At least for me⁠—so sweet as drowsy noons, And evenings steep’d in honied indolence ; O, for an age so shelter’d from annoy,</p>
			<p>That I may never know how change the moons, Or hear the voice of busy common-sense !</p>
			<p>And once more came they by ;⁠—alas ! wherefore ?</p>
			<p>My sleep had been embroider’d with dim dreams ; My soul had been a lawn besprinkled o’er With flowers, and stirring shades, and baffled beams : The morn was clouded, but no shower fell, Tho’ in her lids hung the sweet tears of May ;</p>
			<p>The open casement press’d a new-leaved vine. Let in the budding warmth and throstle’s lay; O Shadows ! ‘t was a time to bid farewell!</p>
			<p>Upon your skirts had fallen no tears of mine.</p>
			<p>VI</p>
			<p>So, ye three Ghosts, adieu 1 Ye cannot raise</p>
			<p>My head cool-bedded in the flowery grass; For I would not be dieted with praise,</p>
			<p>A pet-lamb in a sentimental farce ! Fade softly from my eyes and be once more</p>
			<p>In masque-like figures on the dreamy urn; Farewell! I yet have visions for the night. And for the day faint visions there is store ;</p>
			<p>Vanish, ye Phantoms ! from my idle spright,</p>
			<p>Into the clouds, and nevermore return !</p>

			<p>“Why did I laugh to-night ? No voice will tell;</p>
			<p>No God, no Demon of severe response, Deigns to reply from Heaven or from Hell:</p>
			<p>Then to my human heart I turn at once. Heart 1 Thou and I are here sad and alone ;</p>
			<p>I say, why did I laugh ? O mortal pain! O Darkness ! Darkness! ever must I moan.</p>
			<p>To question Heaven and Hell and Heart in vain. Why did I laugh ? I know this Being’s lease.</p>
			<p>My fancy to its utmost blisses spreads ; Yet would I on this very midnight cease,</p>

			<p>Ah ! dearest love, sweet home of all my fears.</p>
			<p>And hopes, and joys, and panting miseries⁠—To-night, if I may guess, thy beauty wears A smile of such delight. As brilliant and as bright. As when with ravish’d, aching, vassal eyes, Lost in soft amaze, I gaze, I gaze !</p>

			<p>Save it for me, sweet love ! though music breathe</p>
			<p>Voluptuous visions into the warm air, Though swimming through the dance’s dangerous wreath ; Be like an April day Smiling and cold and gay, A temperate lily, temperatf> as fair ; Then, Heaven ! there will be A warmer June for me.</p>

			<p>As blow-ball from the mead ?</p>
			<p>I know it⁠—and to know it is despair</p>
			<p>To one who loves you as I love, sweet Fanny ! Whose heart goes fluttering for you everywhere, Nor, when away you roam. Dare keep its wretched home : Love, love alone, has pains severe and many: Then, loveliest! keep me free From torturing jealousy.</p>

			<p>I</p>
			<p>Shed no tear ! O shed no tear ! The flower will bloom another year. Weep no more ! O weep no more ! Young buds sleep in the root’s white core. Dry your eyes! O dry your eyes, For I was taught in Paradise To ease my breast of melodies⁠—</p>
			<p>Shed no tear.</p>
			<p>Overhead ! look overhead ‘Mong the blossoms white and red⁠—Look up, look up⁠—I flutter now On this flush pomegranate bough. See me ! ‘t is this silvery bill Ever cures the good man’s ill. Shed no tear ! O shed no tear ! The flower will bloom another year. Adieu, Adieu⁠—I fly, adieu, I vanish in the heaven’s blue⁠—</p>
			<p>Adieu, Adieu!</p>
			<p>Ah ! woe is me ! poor silver-wing! That I must chant thy lady’s dirge,</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-247"/>
			<p>And death to this fair haunt of spring, Of melody, and streams of flowery verge⁠—Poor silver-wing ! ah! woe is me ! That I must see These blossoms snow upon thy lady’s pall! Go, pretty page! and in her ear Whisper that the hour is near ! Softly tell her not to fear Such calm favonian burial! Go, pretty page! and soothly tell⁠—The blossoms hang by a melting spell, And fall they must, ere a star wink thrice</p>
			<p>Upon her closed eyes, That now in vain are weeping their last tears,</p>
			<p>At sweet life leaving, and those arbours green⁠—Rich dowry from the Spirit of the Spheres⁠—Alas ! poor Queen !</p>
			<p>ON FAME</p>
			<p>‘ You cannot eat your cake and have it too.’⁠—Proverb.</p>
			<p>How fever’d is that man, who cannot look</p>
			<p>Upon his mortal days with temperate blood, Who vexes all the leaves of his life’s book.</p>
			<p>And robs his fair name of its maidenhood: It is as if the rose should pluck herself.</p>
			<p>Or the ripe plum finger its misty bloom ; As if a Naiad, like a meddling elf.</p>
			<p>Should darken her pure grot with muddy gloom. But the rose leaves herself upon the brier,</p>
			<p>For winds to kiss and grateful bees to feed. And the ripe plum still wears its dim attire, The undisturbed lake has crystal space : Why then should man, teasing the world for grace,</p>
			<p>Spoil his salvation for a fierce miscreed?</p>

			<p>ANOTHER ON FAME</p>
			<p>Fame, like a wayward girl, will still be coy</p>
			<p>To those who woo her with too slavish knees, But makes surrender to some thoughtless boy,</p>
			<p>And dotes the more upon a heart at ease; She is a Gipsy⁠—will not speak to those</p>
			<p>Who have not learnt to be content without her ; A Jilt, whose ear was never whisper’d close,</p>
			<p>Who thinks they scandal her who talk about her; A very Gipsy is she, Nilus-born,</p>
			<p>Sister-in-law to jealous Potiphar; Ye lovesick Bards! repay her scorn for scorn ;</p>
			<p>Ye Artists lovelorn! madmen that ye are! Make your best bow to her and bid adieu, Then, if she likes it, she will follow you.</p>
			<p>TO SLEEP</p>
			<p>O SOFT embalmer of the still midnight.</p>
			<p>Shutting, with careful fingers and benign. Our gloomj^leased eyes, embower’d from the light,</p>
			<p>Enshaded in forgetfulness divine : O soothest Sleep ! if so it please thee, close,</p>
			<p>In midst of this thine hymn, my willing eyes, Or wait the amen, ere thy poppy throws</p>
			<p>Around my bed its dewy charities ;</p>
			<p>Then save me, or the passed day will shine Upon my pillow, breeding many woes;</p>
			<p>Save me from curious conscience, that still lords Its strength for darkness, burrowing like a mole ;</p>

			<p>ODE TO PSYCHE</p>
			<p>0 Goddess ! hear these tuneless numbers, wrung By sweet enforcement and remembrance dear,</p>
			<p>And pardon that thy secrets should be sung Even into thine own soft-conched ear:</p>
			<p>Surely I dreamt to-day, or did I see The winged Psyche with awaken’d eyes ?</p>
			<p>1 wander’d in a forest thoughtlessly,</p>
			<p>And, on the sudden, fainting with surprise. Saw two fair creatures, couched side by side In deepest grass, beneath the whisp’ring roof Of leaves and trembled blossoms, where there ran A brooklet, scarce espied :</p>
			<p>‘Mid hush’d, cool-rooted flowers fragrant eyed,</p>
			<p>Blue, silver-white, and budded Tyrian, They lay calm-breathing on the bedded grass ;</p>
			<p>Their arms embraced, and their pinions too;</p>
			<p>Their lips touch’d not, but had not bade adieu, As if disjoined by soft-handed slumber, And ready still past kisses to outnumber</p>
			<p>At tender eye-dawn of aurorean love : The winged boy I knew ;</p>
			<p>But who wast thou, O happy, happy dove ? His Psyche true !</p>
			<p>Ill O latest-born and loveliest vision far Of all Olympus’ faded hierarchy 1 Fairer than Phoebe’s sapphire-region’d star,</p>
			<p>Or Vesper, amorous glow-worm of the sky;</p>
			<p>Fairer than these, though temple thou hast none,</p>
			<p>Nor altar heap’d with flowxrs ;</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-250"/>
			<p>Nor virgin-choir to make delicious moan</p>
			<p>Upon the midnight hours ; No voice, no lute, no pipe, no incense sweet</p>
			<p>From chain-swung censer teeming; No shrine, no grove, no oracle, no heat</p>
			<p>Of pale-mouth’d prophet dreaming.</p>
			<p>0 brightest! though too late for antique vows, Too, too late for the fond believing lyre.</p>
			<p>When holy were the haunted forest boughs, Holy the air, the water, and the fire ;</p>
			<p>Yet even in these days so far retired ^ From happy pieties, thy lucent fans. Fluttering among the faint Olympians,</p>
			<p>1 see, and sing, by my own eyes inspired. So let me be thy choir, and make a moan</p>
			<p>Upon the midnight hours ; Thy voice, thy lute, thy pipe, thy incense sweet</p>
			<p>From swinged censer teeming ; Thy shrine, thy grove, thy oracle, thy heat</p>
			<p>Of pale-mouth’d prophet dreaming.</p>
			<p>Yes, I will be thy priest, and build a fane</p>
			<p>In some untrodden region of my mind. Where branched thoughts, new-grown with pleasant pain.</p>
			<p>Instead of pines shall murmur in the wind : Far, far around shall those dark-cluster’d trees</p>
			<p>Fledge the wild-ridged mountains steep by steep ; And there by zephyrs, streams, and birds, and bees,</p>
			<p>The moss-lain Dryads shall be lulled to sleep, And in the midst of this wide quietness A rosy sanctuary will I dress With the wreath’d trellis of a working brain,</p>
			<p>With buds, and bells, and stars without a name.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-251"/>
			<p>With all the gardener Fancy e’er could feign,</p>
			<p>Who breeding flowers, will never breed the same: And there shall be for thee all soft delight</p>
			<p>That shadowy thought can win, A bright torch, and a casement ope at night,</p>
			<p>To let the warm Love in !</p>
			<p>SONNET</p>
			<p>If by dull rhymes our English must be chain’d,</p>
			<p>And, like Andromeda, the Sonnet sweet Fetter’d, in spite of pained loveliness ; Let us find out, if we must be constrain’d,</p>
			<p>Sandals more interwoven and complete To fit the naked foot of poesy; Let us inspect the lyre, and weigh the stress Of every chord, and see what may be gain’d</p>
			<p>By ear industrious, and attention meet; Misers of sound and syllable, no less Than Midas of his coinage, let us be</p>
			<p>Jealous of dead leaves in the bay-wreath crown: So, if we may not let the Muse be free.</p>
			<p>She will be bound with garlands of her own.</p>
			<p>ODE TO A NIGHTINGALE</p>
			<p>I My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk, Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains</p>
			<p>One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk: ‘T is not through envy of thy happy lot, But being too happy in thine happiness⁠—That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees, In some melodious plot Of beechen green, and shadows numberless, Singest of summer in full-throated ease.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-252"/>
			<p>O for a draught of vintage! that hath been</p>
			<p>Cool’d a long age in the deep-delved earth, Tasting of Flora and the country-green,</p>
			<p>Dance, and Provengal song, and sunburnt mirth 1 O for a beaker full of the warm South, Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene, With beaded bubbles winking at the brim, And purple-stained mouth ; That I might drink, and leave the world unseen, And with thee fade away into the forest dim :</p>
			<p>Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget</p>
			<p>What thou among the leaves hast never known. The weariness, the fever, and the fret</p>
			<p>Here, where men sit and hear each other groan ; Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs, Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies; Where but to think is to be full of sorrow And leaden-eyed despairs, Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes, Or new Love pine at them beyond to-morrow.</p>
			<p>Away ! away ! for I will fly to thee,</p>
			<p>Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards, But on the viewless wings of Poesy,</p>
			<p>Though the dull brain perplexes and retards : Already with thee ! tender is the night, And haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne, Cluster’d around by all her starry Fays ; But here there is no light. Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-253"/>
			<p>V</p>
			<p>I cannot see what flowers are at my feet, /</p>
			<p>Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs, But, in embalmed darkness, guess each sweet</p>
			<p>Wherewith the seasonable month endows The grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild ; White hawthorn, and the pastoral eglantine ; Fast fading violets cover’d up in leaves; And mid-May’s eldest child, The coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine, The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves.</p>
			<p>VI</p>
			<p>Darkling I listen ; and, for many a time</p>
			<p>I have been half in love with easeful Death, Call’d him soft names in many a mused rhyme,</p>
			<p>To take into the air my quiet breath; Now more than ever seems it rich to die, To cease upon the midnight with no pain’, While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad In such an ecstacy ! Still wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain⁠—To thy high requiem become a sod.</p>
			<p>VII</p>
			<p>Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird !</p>
			<p>No hungry generations tread thee down ; The voice I hear this passing night was heard</p>
			<p>In ancient days by emperor and clown : Perhaps the self-same song that found a path Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home, She stood in tears amid the alien corn ; The same that oft-times hath Charm’d magic casements, opening on the foam Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-254"/>
			<p>VIII</p>
			<p>Forlorn ! the very word is like a bell</p>
			<p>To toll me back from thee to my sole self! Adieu ! the fancy cannot cheat so well</p>
			<p>As she is famed to do, deceiving elf, *</p>
			<p>Adieu ! adieu ! thy plaintive anthem fades Past the near meadows, over the still stream, Up the hill-side ; and now ‘t is buried deep In the next valley-glades : Was it a vision, or a waking dream ? Fled is that music:⁠—do I wake or sleep ?</p>
			<p>LAMIA</p>
			<p>PART I</p>
			<p>Upon a time, before the faery broods</p>
			<p>Drove Nymph and Satyr from the prosperous woods,</p>
			<p>Before King Oberon’s bright diadem,</p>
			<p>Sceptre, and mantle, clasp’d with dewy gem,</p>
			<p>Frighted away the Dryads and the Fauns</p>
			<p>From rushes green, and brakes, and cowslipp’d</p>
			<p>lawns, The ever-smitten Hermes empty left His golden throne, bent warm on amorous theft; From high Olympus had he stolen light. On this side of Jove’s clouds, to escape the sight 10 Of his great summer, and made retreat Into a forest on the shores of Crete. For somewhere in that sacred island dwelt A nymph, to whom all hoofed Satyrs knelt; At whose white feet the languid Tritons poured Pearls, while on land they wither’d and adored. Fast by the springs where she to bathe was wont, And in those meads where sometimes she might</p>
			<p>haunt, Were strewn rich gifts, unknown to any Muse,</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-255"/>
			<p>Though Fancy’s casket were unlock’d to choose. 20</p>
			<p>Ah, what a world of love was at her feet!</p>
			<p>So Hermes thought, and a celestial heat</p>
			<p>Burnt from his winged heels to either ear,</p>
			<p>That from a whiteness, as the lily clear,</p>
			<p>Blush’d into roses ‘mid his golden hair,</p>
			<p>Fallen in jealous curls about his shoulders bare.</p>
			<p>From vale to vale, from wood to wood, he flew, Breathing upon the flowers his passion new. And wound with many a river to its head. To find where this sweet nymph prepared her secret bed: 30</p>
			<p>In vain ; the sweet nymph might nowhere be found, And so he rested, on the lonely ground, Pensive, and full of painful jealousies Of the Wood^Gods, and even the very trees. There as he stood, he heard a mournful voice, Such as once heard, in gentle heart, destroys All pain but pity: thus the lone voice spake : * When from this wreathed tomb shall I awake ! When move in a sweet body fit for life. And love, and pleasure, and the ruddy strife 40</p>
			<p>Of hearts and lips! Ah, miserable me !’ The God, dove-footed, glided silently Round bush and tree, soft-brushing, in his speed, The taller grasses and full-flowering weed, Until he found a palpitating snake, Bright, and cirque-couchant in a dusky brake.</p>
			<p>She was a gordian shape of dazzling hue, Vermilion-spotted, golden, green, and blue ; Striped like a zebra, freckled like a pard, Eyed like a peacock, and all crimson barr’d ; 50</p>
			<p>And full of silver moons, that, as she breathed, Dissolved, or brighter shone, or interwreathed Their lustres with the gloomier tapestries⁠—So rainbow-sided, touch’d with miseries.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-256"/>
			<p>She seem’d, at once, some penanced lady elf, Some demon’s mistress, or the demon’s self. Upon her crest she wore a wannish fire ;</p>
			<p>Sprinkled with stars, like Ariadne’s tiar : Her head was serpent, but ah, bitter-sweet! She had a woman’s mouth with all its pearls complete : 60 And for her eyes⁠—what could such eyes do there But weep, and weep, that they were born so</p>
			<p>fair? As Proserpine still weeps for her Sicilian air. Her throat was serpent, but the words she spake Came, as through bubbling honey, for Love’s sake, And thus ; while Hermes on his pinions lay, Like a stoop’d falcon ere he takes his prey :</p>
			<p>‘ Fair Hermes ! crown’d with feathers, fluttering</p>
			<p>light, I had a splendid dream of thee last night: I saw thee sitting, on a throne of gold, 70</p>
			<p>Among the Gods, upon Olympus old, The only sad one ; for thou didst not hear The soft, lute-finger’d Muses chanting clear. Nor even Apollo when he sang alone, Deaf to his throbbing throat’s long, long melodious</p>
			<p>moan. I dreamt I saw thee, robed in purple flakes. Break amorous through the clouds, as morning</p>
			<p>breaks, And, swiftly as a bright Phoebean dart. Strike for the Cretan isle ; and here thou art! Too gentle Hermes, hast thou found the maid ?’ 80 Whereat the star of Lethe not delay’d His rosy eloquence, and thus inquired: ‘ Thou smooth-lipp’d serpent, surely high-inspired I Thou beauteous wreath, with melancholy eyes. Possess whatever bliss thou canst devise. Telling me only where my nymph is fled⁠—</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-257"/>
			<p>Where she doth breathe !’ * Bright planet, thou</p>
			<p>hast said,’ Return’d the snake, ‘ but seal with oaths, fair God!’ ‘ I swear,’ said Hermes, ‘ by my serpent rod, And by thine eyes, and by thy starry crown! 90</p>
			<p>Light flew his earnest words, among the blossoms</p>
			<p>blown. Then thus again the brilliance feminine : ‘ Too frail of heart! for this lost nymph of thine, Free as the air, invisibly, she strays About these thornless wilds; her pleasant days She tastes unseen; unseen her nimble feet Leave traces in the grass and flowers sweet; From weary tendrils, and bow’d branches green, She plucks the fruit unseen, she bathes unseen : And by my power is her beauty veil’d 100</p>
			<p>To keep it unaffronted, unassail’d By the love-glances of unlovely eyes. Of Satyrs, Fauns, and blear’d Silenus’ sighs. Pale grew her immortality, for woe Of all these lovers, and she grieved so I took compassion on her, bade her steep Her hair in wei’rd syrops, that would keep Her loveliness invisible, yet free To wander as she loves, in liberty. Thou shalt behold her, Hermes, thou alone, no</p>
			<p>If thou wilt, as thou swearest, grant my boon !’ Then, once again, the charmed God began An oath, and through the serpent’s ears it ran Warm, tremulous, devout, psalterian. Ravish’d she lifted her Circean head, Blush’d a live damask, and swift-lisping said, ‘ I was a woman, let me have once more A woman’s shape, and charming as before. I love a youth of Corinth⁠—O the bliss! Give me my woman’s form, and place me where he</p>
			<p>is. 120</p>
			<p>Stoop, Hermes, let me breathe upon thy brow,</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-258"/>
			<p>And thou shalt see thy sweet nymph even now/ The God on half-shut feathers sank serene, She breathed upon his eyes, and swift was seen Of both the guarded nymph near-smiling on the</p>
			<p>green. It was no dream ; or say a dream it was, Real are the dreams of Gods, and smoothly pass Their pleasures in a long immortal dream. One warm, flush’d moment, hovering, it might seem Dash’d by the wood-nymph’s beauty, so he burn’d ; Then, lighting on the pnntless verdure, turn’d 131 To the swoon’d serpent, and with languid arm, Delicate, put to proof the lithe Caducean charm. So done, upon the nymph his eyes he bent Full of adoring tears and blandishment. And towards her stept: she, like a moon in wane, Faded before him, cower’d, nor could restrain Her fearful sobs, self-folding like a flower That faints into itself at evening hour: But the God fostering her chilled hand, 140</p>
			<p>She felt the warmth, her eyelids open’d bland, And, like new flowers at morning song of bees, Bloom’d, and gave up her honey to the lees. Into the green-recessed woods they flew; Nor grew they pale, as mortal lovers do.</p>
			<p>Left to herself, the serpent now began To change ; her elfin blood in madness ran, Her mouth foam’d, and the grass, therewith besprent, Wither’d at dew so sweet and virulent; Her eyes in torture fix’d, and anguish drear, 150</p>
			<p>Hot, glazed, and wide, with lid-lashes all sear, Flash’d phosphor and sharp sparks, without</p>
			<p>cooling tear. The colours all inflamed throughout her train, She writhed about, convulsed with scarlet pain A deep volcanian yellow took the place</p>
			<p>1</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-259"/>
			<p>Of all her milder-mooned body’s grace ;</p>
			<p>And, as the lava ravishes the mead,</p>
			<p>Spoilt all her silver mail, and golden brede:</p>
			<p>Made gloom of all her frecklings, streaks and bars,</p>
			<p>Eclipsed her crescents, and lick’d up her stars : 160</p>
			<p>So that, in moments few, she was undrest</p>
			<p>Of all her sapphires, greens, and amethyst.</p>
			<p>And rubious-argent: of all these bereft,</p>
			<p>Nothing but pain and ugliness were left.</p>
			<p>Still shone her crown ; that vanish’d, also she</p>
			<p>Melted and disappear’d as suddenly ;</p>
			<p>And in the air, her new voice luting soft.</p>
			<p>Cried, ‘Lycius ! gentle Lycius! ‘⁠—Borne aloft</p>
			<p>With the bright mists about the mountains hoar</p>
			<p>These words dissolved: Crete’s forests heard no</p>
			<p>Whither fled Lamia, now a lady bright, A full-born beauty new and exquisite ? She fled into that valley they pass o’er Who go to Corinth from Cenchreas’ shore ; And rested at the foot of those wild hills, The rugged founts of the Persean rills, And of that other ridge whose barren back Stretches, with all its mist and cloudy rack. South-westward to Cleone. There she stood About a young bird’s flutter from a wood, 180</p>
			<p>Fair, on a sloping green of mossy tread. By a clear pool, wherein she passioned To see herself escaped from so sore ills, While her robes flaunted with the daffodils.</p>
			<p>Ah, happy Lycius !⁠—for she was a maid More beautiful than ever twisted braid, Or sigh’d, or blush’d, or on spring-flowered lea Spread a green kirtle to the minstrelsy : A virgin purest lipp’d, yet in the lore Of love deep learned to the red heart’s core : 190</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-260"/>
			<p>Not one hour old, yet of sciential brain</p>
			<p>To unperplex bliss from its neighbour pain;</p>
			<p>Define their pettish limits, and estrange</p>
			<p>Their points of contact, and swift counterchange;</p>
			<p>Intrigue with the specious chaos, and dispart</p>
			<p>Its most ambiguous atoms with sure art;</p>
			<p>As though in Cupid’s college she had spent</p>
			<p>Sweet days a lovely graduate, still unshent,</p>
			<p>And kept his rosy terms in idle languishment.</p>
			<p>Why this fair creature chose so fairily 21</p>
			<p>By the wayside to linger, we shall see ; But first’t is fit to tell how she could muse And dream, when in the serpent prison-house. Of all she list, strange or magnificent : How, ever, where she will’d, her spirit went; Whether to faint Elysium, or where Down through tress-lifting waves the Nereids fair Wind into Thetis’ bower by many a pearly stair ; Or where God Bacchus drains his cups divine. Stretch’d out, at ease, beneath a glutinous pine ; 2 Or where in Pluto’s gardens palatine Mulciber’s columns gleam in far piazzian line. And sometimes into cities she would send Her dream, with feast and rioting to blend; And once, while among mortals dreaming thus, She saw the young Corinthian Lycius Charioting foremost in the envious race. Like a young Jove with calm uneager face, And fell into a swooning love of him. Now on the moth-time of that evening dim 2</p>
			<p>He would return that way, as well she knew. To Corinth from the shore; for freshly blew The eastern soft wind, and his galley now Grated the quay-stones with her brazen prow In port Cenchreas, from Egina isle Fresh anchor’d ; whither he had been awhile To sacrifice to Jove, whose temple there</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-261"/>
			<p>Waits with high marble doors for blood and incense</p>
			<p>rare. Jove heard his vows, and better’d his desire ; For by some freakful chance he made retire 230</p>
			<p>From his companions, and set forth to walk, Perhaps grown wearied of their Corinth talk : Over the solitary hills he fared, Thoughtless at first, but ere eve’s star appear’d His phantasy was lost, where reason fades. In the calm’d twilight of Platonic shades. Lamia beheld him coming, near, more near⁠—Close to her passing, in indifference drear, His silent sandals swept the mossy green ; So neighbour’d to him, and yet so unseen 240</p>
			<p>She stood : he pass’d, shut up in mysteries. His mind wrapp’d like his mantle, while her eyes Follow’d his steps, and her neck regal white Turn’d⁠—syllabling thus, ‘ Ah, Lycius bright! And will you leave me on the hills alone ? Lycius, look back! and be some pity shown.’ He did; not with cold wonder fearingly. But Orpheus-like at an Eurydice ; For so delicious were the words she sung. It seem’d he had loved them a whole summer long: And soon his eyes had drunk her beauty up, 251</p>
			<p>Leaving no drop in the bewildering cup. And still the cup was full⁠—while he, afraid Lest she should vanish ere his lips had paid Due adoration, thus began to adore ; Her soft look growing coy, she saw his chain so</p>
			<p>sure : ‘ Leave thee alone! Look back! Ah, Goddess,</p>
			<p>see “Whether my eyes can ever turn from thee ! For pity do not this sad heart belie⁠—Even as thou vanishest so I shall die. 260</p>
			<p>Stay ! though a Naiad of the rivers, stay ! To thy far wishes will thy streams obey :</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-262"/>
			<p>Stay ! though the greenest woods be thy domain,</p>
			<p>Alone they can drink up the morning rain:</p>
			<p>Though a descended Pleiad, will not one</p>
			<p>Of thine harmonious sisters keep in tune</p>
			<p>Thy spheres, and as thy silver proxy shine ?</p>
			<p>So sweetly to these ravish’d ears of mine</p>
			<p>Came thy sweet greeting, that if thou shouldst</p>
			<p>fade, Thy memory will waste me to a shade :⁠—270</p>
			<p>For pity do not melt!’⁠—‘ If I should stay,’ Said Lamia, ‘ here, upon this floor of clay, And pain my steps upon these flowers too rough. What canst thou say or do of charm enough To dull the nice remembrance of my home ? Thou canst not ask me with thee here to roam Over these hills and vales, where no joy is⁠—Empty of immortality and bliss! Thou art a scholar, Lycius, and must know That finer spirits cannot breathe below 280</p>
			<p>In human climes, and live ; Alas ! poor youth, What taste of purer air hast thou to soothe My essence ? What serener palaces, Where I may all my many senses please, And by mysterious sleights a hundred thirsts appease ? It cannot be⁠—Adieu !’ So said, she rose Tiptoe with white arms spread. He, sick to lose The amorous promise of her lone complain, Swoon’d murmuring of love, and pale with pain. The cruel lady, without any show 290</p>
			<p>Of sorrow for her tender favourite’s woe, But rather, if her eyes could brighter be. With brighter eyes and slow amenity. Put her new lips to his, and gave afresh The life she had so tangled in her mesh : And as he from one trance was weakening Into another, she began to sing, Happy in beauty, life, and love, and every thing,</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-263"/>
			<p>A song of love, too sweet for earthly lyres, While, like held breath, the stars drew in their panting fires. 300 And then she whisper’d in such trembling tone. As those who, safe together met alone For the first time through many anguish’d days, Use other speech than looks; bidding him raise His drooping head, and clear his soul of doubt, For that she was a woman, and without Any more subtle fluid in her veins Than throbbing blood, and that the self-same pains Inhabited her frail-strung heart as his. And next she wonder’d how his eyes could miss 310 Her face so long in Corinth, where, she said, She dwelt but half retired, and there had led Days happy as the gold coin could invent Without the aid of love ; yet in content Till she saw him, as once she pass’d him by, Where ’gainst a column he leant thoughtfully At Venus’ temple porch, ‘mid baskets heap’d Of amorous herbs and flowers, aewly reap’d Late on that eve, as ‘t was the night before The Adonian feast; whereof she saw no more, 320 But wept alone those days, for why should she</p>
			<p>adore ? Lycius from death awoke into amaze, To see her still, and singing so sweet lays ; Then from amaze into delight he fell To hear her whisper woman’s lore so well ; And every word she spake enticed him on To unperplex’d delight and pleasure known. Let the mad poets say whate’er they please Of the sweets of Fairies, Peris, Goddesses, There is not such a treat among them all, 330</p>
			<p>Haunters of cavern, lake, and waterfall, As a real woman, lineal indeed From Pyrrha’s pebbles or old Adam’s seed. Thus gentle Lamia judged, and judged aright,</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-264"/>
			<p>That Lycius could not love in half a fright,</p>
			<p>So threw the goddess off, and won his heart</p>
			<p>More pleasantly by playing woman’s part,</p>
			<p>With no more awe than what her beauty gave,</p>
			<p>That, while it smote, still guaranteed to save.</p>
			<p>Lycius to all made eloquent reply, 340</p>
			<p>Marrying to every word a twin-born sigh:</p>
			<p>And last, pointing to Corinth, ask’d her sweet,</p>
			<p>If ‘t was too far that night for her soft feet.</p>
			<p>The way was short, for Lamia’s eagerness</p>
			<p>Made, by a spell, the triple league decrease</p>
			<p>To a few paces; not at all surmised</p>
			<p>By blinded Lycius, so in her comprised :</p>
			<p>They pass’d the city gates, he knew not how.</p>
			<p>So noiseless, and he never thought to know.</p>
			<p>As men talk in a dream, so Corinth all, 350</p>
			<p>Throughout her palaces imperial. And all her populous streets and temples lewd, Mutter’d, like tempest in the distance brew’d. To the wide-spreaded night above her towers. Men, women, rich and poor, in the cool hours. Shuffled their sandals o’er the pavement white, Companion’d or alone ; while many a light Flared, here and there, from wealthy festivals. And threw their moving shadows on the walls, Or found them cluster’d in the corniced shade 360 Of some arch’d temple door, or dusky colonnade.</p>
			<p>Muffling his face, of greeting friends in fear. Her fingers he press’d hard, as one came near With curl’d gray beard, sharp eyes, and smooth bald</p>
			<p>crown, Slow-stepp’d, and robed in philosophic gown: Lycius shrank closer, as they met and past. Into his mantle, adding wings to haste. While hurried Lamia trembled: ‘ Ah,’ said he, ‘Why do you shudder, love, so ruefully ?</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-265"/>
			<p>Why does your tender palm dissolve in dew ?’⁠—370 ‘ I ‘m wearied,’ said fair Lamia : * tell me who Is that old man ? I cannot bring to mind His features:⁠—Lycius ! wherefore did you blind Yourself from his quick eyes ?’ Lycius replied, ‘ ‘T is Apollonius sage, my trusty guide And good instructor ; but to-night he seems The ghost of folly haunting my sweet dreams.’</p>
			<p>“While yet he spake they had arrived before A pillar’d porch, with lofty portal door. Where hung a silver lamp, whose phosphor glow 380 Reflected in the slabbed steps below, Mild as a star in water; for so new And so unsullied was the marble hue, So through the crystal polish, liquid fine, Ran the dark veins, that none but feet divine Could e’er have touch’d there. Sounds ^olian Breathed from the hinges, as the ample span Of the wide doors disclosed a place unknown Some time to any, but those two alone. And a few Persian mutes, who that same year 390 Were seen about the markets: none knew where They could inhabit; the most curious Were foil’d, who watch’d to trace them to their</p>
			<p>house: And but the flitter-winged verse must tell, For truth’s sake, what woe afterwards befell, ‘T would humour many a heart to leave them thus. Shut from the busy world of more incredulous.</p>
			<p>PART II</p>
			<p>Love in a hut, with water and a crust,</p>
			<p>Is⁠—Love, forgive us!⁠—cinders, ashes, dust;</p>
			<p>Love in a palace is perhaps at last</p>
			<p>More grievous torment than a hermit’s fast:⁠—</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-266"/>
			<p>That is a doubtful tale from faery land, Hard for the non-elect to understand. Had Lycius lived to hand his story down, He might have given the moral a fresh frown. Or clench’d it quite : but too short was their bliss To breed distrust and hate, that make the soft voice hiss. 10</p>
			<p>Besides, there, nightly, with terrific glare. Love, jealous grown of so complete a pair Hover’d and buzz’d his wings, with fearful roar, Above the lintel of their chamber door, And down the passage cast a glow upon the floor.</p>
			<p>For all this came a ruin : side by side They were enthroned, in the even tide, Upon a couch, near to a curtaining Whose airy texture, from a golden string, Floated into the room, and let appear 20</p>
			<p>Unveil’d the summer heaven, blue and clear, Betwixt two marble shafts :⁠—there they reposed. Where use had made it sweet, with eyelids closed. Saving a tithe which love still open kept. That they might see each other while they almost</p>
			<p>slept; When from the slope side of a suburb hill. Deafening the swallow’s twitter, came a thrill Of trumpets⁠—Lycius started⁠—the sounds fled. But left a thought, a buzzing in his head. For the first time, since first he harbour’d in 30</p>
			<p>That purple-lined palace of sweet sin, His spirit pass’d beyond its golden bourn Into the noisy world almost forsworn. The lady, ever watchful, penetrant, Saw this with pain, so arguing a want Of something more, more than her empery Of joys ; and she began to moan and sigh Because he mused beyond her, knowing well That but a moment’s thought is passion’s passing bell.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-267"/>
			<p>‘Why do you sigh, fair creature ?’ whisper’d he : 40 ‘ Why do you think ?’ return’d she tenderly : ‘ You have deserted me ;⁠—where am I now ? Not in your heart while care weighs on your</p>
			<p>brow : No, no, you have dismiss’d me ; and I go From your breast houseless : aye, it must be so.’ He answer’d, bending to her open eyes, Where he was mirror’d small in paradise, ‘ My silver planet, both of eve and morn ! Why will you plead yourself so sad forlorn, While I am striving how to fill my heart 50</p>
			<p>With deeper crimson, and a double smart ? How to entangle, trammel up and snare Your soul in mine, and labyrinth you there, Like the hid scent in an unbudded rose ? Aye, a sweet kiss⁠—you see your mighty woes. My thoughts ! shall I unveil them ? Listen then ! What mortal hath a prize, that other men May be confounded and abash’d withal, But lets it sometimes pace abroad majestical, And triumph, as in thee I should rejoice 60</p>
			<p>Amid the hoarse alarm of Corinth’s voice. Let my foes choke, and my friends shout afar, While through the thronged streets your bridal car Wheels round its dazzling spokes.’⁠—The lady’s</p>
			<p>cheek Trembled ; she nothing said, but, pale and meek. Arose and knelt before him, wept a rain Of sorrows at his words ; at last with pain Beseeching him, the while his hand she wrung, To change his purpose. He thereat was stung, Perverse, with stronger fancy to reclaim 70</p>
			<p>Her wild and timid nature to his aim; Besides, for all his love, in self despite. Against his better self, he took delight Luxurious in her sorrows, soft and new. His passion, cruel grown, took on a hue</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-268"/>
			<p>Fierce and sanguineous as ‘t was possible</p>
			<p>In one whose brow had no dark veins to swell.</p>
			<p>Fine was the mitigated fury, like</p>
			<p>Apollo’s presence when in act to strike</p>
			<p>The serpent⁠—Ha ! the serpent! certes, she 80</p>
			<p>Was none. She burnt, she loved the tyranny,</p>
			<p>And, all subdued, consented to the hour</p>
			<p>When to the bridal he should lead his paramour.</p>
			<p>Whispering in midnight silence, said the youth,</p>
			<p>‘ Sure some sweet name thou hast, though, by my</p>
			<p>truth, I have not ask’d it, ever thinking thee Not mortal, but of heavenly progeny, As still I do. Hast any mortal name, Fit appellation for this dazzling frame ? Or friends or kinsfolk on the citied earth, 90</p>
			<p>To share our marriage feast and nuptial mirth ?’ * I have no friends,’ said Lamia, ‘ no, not one ; My presence in wide Corinth hardly known: My parents’ bones are in their dusty urns Sepulchred, where no kindled incense burns, Seeing all their luckless race are dead, save me. And I neglect the holy rite for thee. Even as you list invite your many guests ; But if, as now it seems, your vision rests With any pleasure on me, do not bid 100</p>
			<p>Old Apollonius⁠—from him keep me hid.’ Lycius, perplex’d at words so blind and blank. Made close inquiry ; from whose touch she shrank, Feigning a sleep ; and he to the dull shade Of deep sleep in a moment was betray’d.</p>
			<p>It was the custom then to bring away The bride from home at blushing shut of day, Veil’d, in a chariot, heralded along By strewn flowers, torches, and a marriage song, With other pageants : but this fair unknown no</p>
			<p>Had not a friend. So being left alone.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-269"/>
			<p>(Lycius was gone to summon all his kin,)</p>
			<p>And knowing snrely she could never win</p>
			<p>His foolish heart from its mad pompousness.</p>
			<p>She set herself, high-thoughted, how to dress</p>
			<p>The misery in fit magnificence.</p>
			<p>She did so, but’t is doubtful how and whence</p>
			<p>Came, and who were her subtle servitors.</p>
			<p>About the halls, and to and from the doors,</p>
			<p>There was a noise of wings, till in short space 120</p>
			<p>The glowing banquet-room shone with wide-arched</p>
			<p>grace. A haunting music, sole perhaps and lone Supportress of the faery-roof, made moan Throughout, as fearful the whole charm might</p>
			<p>fade. Fresh carved cedar, mimicking a glade Of palm and plantain, met from either side, High in the midst, in honour of the bride : Two palms and then two plantains, and so on. From either side their stems branch’d one to one All down the aisled place ; and beneath all 130</p>
			<p>There ran a stream of lamps straight on from wall to</p>
			<p>wall. So canopied, lay an untasted feast Teeming with odours. Lamia, regal drest, Silently paced about, and as she went, In pale contented sort of discontent, Mission’d her viewless servants to enrich The fretted splendour of each nook and niche. Between the tree-stems, marbled plain at first, Came jasper panels ; then, anon, there burst Forth creeping imagery of slighter trees, 140</p>
			<p>And with the larger wove in small intricacies. Approving all, she faded at self-will, And shut the chamber up, close, hush’d and still. Complete and ready for the revels rude, When dreadful guests would come to spoil her solitude.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-270"/>
			<p>The day appear’d, and all the gossip rout. O senseless Lycius ! Madman ! wherefore flout The silent-blessing fate, warm cloister’d hours, And show to common eyes these secret bowers ? The herd approach’d ; each guest, with busy brain, Arriving at the portal, gazed amain, 151</p>
			<p>And enter’d marvelling : for they knew the street, Remember’d it from childhood all complete “Without a gap, yet ne’er before had seen That royal porch, that high-built fair demesne ; So in they hurried all, mazed, curious and keen : Save one, who look’d thereon with eye severe, And with calm-planted steps walk’d in austere: ‘T was Apollonius : something too he laugh’d. As though some knotty problem, that had daft 160 His patient thought, had now begun to thaw, And solve and melt:⁠—‘t was just as he foresaw.</p>
			<p>He met within the murmurous vestibule His young disciple. ‘ ‘T is no common rule, Lycius, ‘■ said he, ‘ for uninvited guest To force himself upon you, and infest “With an unbiddden presence the bright throng Of younger friends ; yet must I do this wrong, And you forgive me.’ Lycius blush’d, and led The old man through the inner doors broadspread ; With reconciling words and courteous mien 171</p>
			<p>Turning into sweet milk the sophist’s spleen.</p>
			<p>Of wealthy lustre was the banquet-room, Fill’d with pervading brilliance and perfume: Before each lucid panel fuming stood A censer fed with myrrh and spiced wood, Each by a sacred tripod held aloft, Whose slender feet wide-swerved upon the soft Wool-woofed carpets : fifty wreaths of smoke From fifty censers their light voyage took 180</p>
			<p>To the high roof, still mimick’d as they rose</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-271"/>
			<p>Along the mirror’d walls by twin-clouds odorous.</p>
			<p>Twelve sphered tables, by silk seats inspher’d,</p>
			<p>High as the level of a man’s breast rear’d</p>
			<p>On libbard’s paws, upheld the heavy gold</p>
			<p>Of cups and goblets, and the store thrice told</p>
			<p>Of Ceres’ horn, and, in huge vessels, wine</p>
			<p>Came from the gloomy tun with merry shine.</p>
			<p>Thus loaded with a feast the tables stood.</p>
			<p>Each shrihing in the midst the image of a God. 190</p>
			<p>When in an antechamber every guest Had felt the cold full sponge to pleasure press’d, By ministering slaves, upon his hands and feet, And fragrant oils with ceremony meet Pour’d on his hair, they all moved to the feast In white robes, and themselves in order placed Around the silken couches, wondering Whence all this mighty cost and blaze of wealth could spring.</p>
			<p>Soft went the music the soft air along, While fluent Greek a vowel’d under-song 200</p>
			<p>Kept up among the guests, discoursing low At first, for scarcely was the wine at flow ; But when the happy vintage touch’d their brains, Louder they talk, and louder come the strains Of powerful instruments :⁠—the gorgeous dyes, The space, the splendour of the draperies. The roof of awful richness, nectarous cheer, Beautiful slaves, and Lamia’s self, appear, Now, when the wine has done its rosy deed. And every soul from human trammels freed, 210</p>
			<p>No more so strange ; for merry wine, sweet wine, Will make Elysian shades not too fair, too divine. Soon was God Bacchus at meridian height; Flush’d were their cheeks, and bright eyes double</p>
			<p>bright: Garlands of every green, and every scent</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-272"/>
			<p>From vales deflower’d, or forest-trees branch-rent. In baskets of bright osier’d gold were brought High as the handles heap’d, to suit the thought Of every guest: that each, as he did please, Might fancy-fit his brows, silk-pillow’d at his ease.</p>
			<p>“What wreath for Lamia ? What for Lycius ? 221 What for the sage, old Apollonius ? Upon her aching forehead be there hung The leaves of willow and of adder’s tongue; And for the youth, quick, let us strip for him The thyrsus, that his watching eyes may swim Into forgetfulness; and, for the sage. Let spear-grass and the spiteful thistle wage War on his temples. Do not all charms fly At the mere touch of cold philosophy ? 230</p>
			<p>There was an awful rainbow once in heaven : We know her woof, her texture ; she is given In the dull catalogue of common things. Philosophy will clip an Angel’s wings, Conquer all mysteries by rule and line. Empty the haunted air, and gnomed mine⁠—Unweave a rainbow, as it erewhile made The tender-person’d Lamia melt into a shade.</p>
			<p>By her glad Lycius sitting, in chief place, Scarce saw in all the room another face, 240</p>
			<p>Till, checking his love trance, a cup he took Full brimm’d, and opposite sent forth a look ‘Cross the broad table, to beseech a glance From his old teacher’s wrinkled countenance, And pledge him. The bald-head philosopher Had fix’d his eye, without a twinkle or stir, Full on the alarmed beauty of the bride. Brow-beating her fair form, and troubling her sweet</p>
			<p>pride. Lycius then press’d her hand, with devout touch. As pale it lay upon the rosy couch : 25°</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-273"/>
			<p>‘T was icy, and the cold ran through his veins ;</p>
			<p>Then sudden it grew hot, and all the pains</p>
			<p>Of an unnatural heat shot to his heart.</p>
			<p>‘ Lamia, what means this ? Wherefore dost thou</p>
			<p>start ? Know’st thou that man?’ Poor Lamia answer’d</p>
			<p>not. He gazed into her eyes, and not a jot Own’d they the lovelorn piteous appeal: More, more he gazed : his human senses reel: Some hungry spell that loveliness absorbs; There was no recognition in those orbs: 260</p>
			<p>‘ Lamia!’ he cried⁠—and no soft-toned reply. The many heard, and the loud revelry Grew hush: the stately music no more breathes ; The myrtle sicken’d in a thousand wreaths. By faint degrees, voice, lute, and pleasure ceased A deadly silence step by step increased. Until it seem’d a horrid presence there. And not a man but felt the terror in his hair. ‘ Lamia!’ he shriek’d ; and nothing but the shriek With its sad echo did the silence break. 270</p>
			<p>* Begone, foul dream!’ he cried, gazing again In the bride’s face, where now no azure vein Wander’d on fair-spaced temples ; no soft bloom Misted the cheek ; no passion to illume The deep-recessed vision:⁠—all was blight; Lamia, no longer fair, there sat a deadly white. ‘Shut, shut those juggling eyes, thou ruthless man! Turn them aside, wretch! or the righteous ban Of all the Gods, whose dreadful images Here represent their shadowy presences, 280</p>
			<p>May pierce them on the sudden with the thorn Of painful blindness; leaving thee forlorn, In trembling dotage to the feeblest fright Of conscience, for their long-offended might, For all thine impious proud-heart sophistries^ Unlawful magic, and enticing lies.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-274"/>
			<p>Corinthians ! look upon that gray-beard wretch!</p>
			<p>Mark how, possess’d, his lashless eyelids stretch</p>
			<p>Around his demon eyes! Corinthians, see !</p>
			<p>My sweet bride withers at their potency.’ 290</p>
			<p>‘ Fool!’ said the sophist, in an under-tone</p>
			<p>Gruff with contempt; which a death-nighing moan</p>
			<p>From Lycius answer’d, as heart-struck and lost.</p>
			<p>He sank supine beside the aching ghost.</p>
			<p>‘ Fool! Fool!’ repeated he, while his eyes still</p>
			<p>Relented not, nor moved ; ‘ from every ill</p>
			<p>Of life have I preserved thee to this day,</p>
			<p>And shall I see thee made a serpent’s prey ?’</p>
			<p>Then Lamia breathed death breath ; the sophist’s</p>
			<p>eye, Like a sharp spear, went through her utterly, 300 Keen, cruel, perceant, stinging : she, as well As her weak hand could any meaning tell, Motion’d him to be silent; vainly so. He look’d and look’d again a level⁠—No ! * A serpent!’ echoed he ; no sooner said. Than with a frightful scream she vanished : And Lycius’ arms were empty of delight. As were his limbs of life, from that same night. On the high couch he lay!⁠—his friends came</p>
			<p>round⁠—Supported him⁠—no pulse or breath they found, 310 And, in its marriage robe, the heavy body wound.</p>

			<p>Auranthe. Conrad ! what tidings ? Good, if I may guess From your alert eyes and high-lifted brows. What tidings of the battle? Albert? Ludolph ? Otho?</p>
			<p>Conrad. You guess aright. And, sister, slurring o’er Our by-gone quarrels, I confess my heart 20</p>
			<p>Is beating with a child’s anxiety. To make our golden fortune known to you.</p>
			<p>Auranthe. So serious ?</p>
			<p>Conrad. Yes, so serious, that before</p>

			<p>Auranthe. He is alive ?</p>
			<p>Conrad. He is ! but here make oath</p>
			<p>To alienate him from your scheming brain,</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-278"/>
			<p>Divorce him from your solitary thoughts,</p>
			<p>And cloud him in such utter banishment, 70</p>
			<p>That when his person meets again your eye,</p>
			<p>Your vision shall quite lose its memory,</p>
			<p>And wander past him as through vacancy.</p>
			<p>Auranthe. I ’11 not be perj ured.</p>
			<p>Conrad. No, nor great, nor mighty ;</p>
			<p>You would not wear a crown, or rule a kingdom. To you it is indifferent.</p>
			<p>Auranthe. What means this ?</p>
			<p>Conrad. You ’11 not be perjured ! Go to Albert then. That camp-mushroom⁠—dishonour of our house. Go, page his dusty heels upon a march. Furbish his jingling baldric while he sleeps, 80</p>
			<p>And share his mouldy ration in a siege. Yet stay⁠—perhaps a charm may call you back. And make the widening circlets of your eyes Sparkle with healthy fevers. — The Emperor Hath given consent that you should marry Lu-dolph!</p>
			<p>Auranthe. Can it be, brother ? For a golden crown With a queen’s awful lips I doubly thank you ! This is to wake in Paradise ! Farewell Thou clod of yesterday⁠—‘t was not myself ! Not till this moment did I ever feel 90</p>
			<p>My spirit’s faculties ! I ’11 flatter you For this, and be you ever proud of it; Thou, Jove-like, struck’dst thy forehead. And from the teeming marrow of thy brain I spring complete Minerva ! but the prince⁠—His highness Ludolph⁠—where is he ?</p>
			<p>Conrad: I know not:</p>
			<p>When, lackying my counsel at a beck. The rebel lords, on bended knees, received The Emperor’s pardon, Ludolph kept aloof, Sole, in a stiff, fool-hardy, sulky pride ; 100</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-279"/>
			<p>Yet, for all this, I never saw a father In such a sickly longing for his son. We shall soon see him, for the Emperor He will be here this morning.</p>
			<p>Auranthe. That I heard</p>
			<p>Among the midnight rumours from the camp.</p>
			<p>Conrad. You give up Albert to me ?</p>
			<p>Auranthe. Harm him not !</p>
			<p>E’en for his highness Ludolph’s sceptry hand, I would not Albert suffer any wrong.</p>
			<p>Conrad. Have I not laboured, plotted⁠—?</p>
			<p>Auranthe. See you spare him :</p>
			<p>Nor be pathetic, my kind benefactor ! no</p>
			<p>On all the many bounties of your hand⁠—‘T was for yourself you laboured⁠—not for me ! Do you not count, when I am queen, to take Advantage of your chance discoveries Of my poor secrets, and so hold a rod Over my life ?</p>
			<p>Conrad. Let not this slave⁠—this villain⁠—</p>
			<p>Be cause of feud between us. See ! he comes ! Look, woman, look, your Albert is quite safe ! In haste it seems. Now shall I be in the way, And wish’d with silent curses in my grave, 120</p>
			<p>Or side by side with ‘whelmed mariners.</p>
			<p>Enter Albert.</p>
			<p>Albert. Fair on your graces fall this early morrow! So it is like to do without my prayers. For your right noble names, like favourite tunes. Have fallen full frequent from our Emperoi-‘s lips. High commented with smiles.</p>
			<p>Auranthe. Noble Albert!</p>
			<p>Conrad {aside). Noble!</p>
			<p>Auranthe. Such salutation argues a glad heart In our prosperity. We thank you, sir.</p>
			<p>Albert. Lady I</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-280"/>
			<p>O, would to Heaven your poor servant</p>
			<p>Could do you better service than mere words! 130</p>
			<p>But I have other greeting than mine own,</p>
			<p>From no less man than Otho, who has sent</p>
			<p>This ring as pledge of dearest amity ;</p>
			<p>‘T is chosen I hear from Hymen’s jewelry,</p>
			<p>And you will prize it, lady, I doubt not,</p>
			<p>Beyond all pleasures past, and all to come.</p>
			<p>To you great duke⁠—</p>
			<p>Conrad. To me ! What of me, ha ?</p>
			<p>Albert. What pleased your grace to say ?</p>
			<p>Conrad. Your message, sir!</p>
			<p>Albert. You mean not this to me ?</p>
			<p>Conrad. Sister, this way ;</p>
			<p>For there shall be no ‘ gentle Alberts’ now, 140</p>
			<p>No ‘ sweet Auranthes!’</p>
			<p>[Exeunt Conrad and Auranthe. Albert (solus). The duke is out of temper; if he knows More than a brother of his sister ought, I should not quarrel with his peevishness. Auranthe⁠—Heaven preserve her always fair!⁠—Is in the heady, proud, ambitious vein ; I bicker not with her⁠—bid her farewell! She has taken flight from me, then let her soar⁠—He is a fool who stands at pining gaze ! But for poor Ludolph, he is food for sorrow : 150 m</p>
			<p>No leveling bluster of my licensed thoughts, |</p>

			<p>Martial Music. Enter, from, the outer gate, Otho, Nobles, Knights, and Attendants. The Soldiers halt at the gate, with Banners in sight.</p>
			<p>Otho. Where is my noble Herald ?</p>
			<p>Enter Conrad, from the Castle, attended ly two Knights and Servants. Albert following.</p>
			<p>Well, hast told Auranthe our intent imperial ? Lest our rent banners, too o’ the sudden shown, Should fright her silken casements, and dismay Her household to our lack of entertainment. A victory !</p>
			<p>Conrad. God save illustrious Otho !</p>
			<p>Otho. Aye, Conrad, it will pluck out all gray hairs ; It is the best physician for the spleen ; The courtliest inviter to a feast; The subtlest excuser of small faults ; 10</p>
			<p>And a nice judge in the age and smack of wine.</p>
			<p>Enter from the Castle, Ajj-rk^hwe., followed by Pages, holding up her robes, and a train of Women. She kneels. Hail my sweet hostess ! I do thank the stars, Or my good soldiers, or their ladies’ eyes, That, after such a merry battle fought, I can, all safe in body and in soul. Kiss your fair hand and lady fortune’s too. My ring ! now, on my life, it doth rejoice These lips to feel’t on this soft ivory ! Keep it, my brightest daughter; it may prove The little prologue to a line of kings. 20</p>
			<p>I strove against thee and my hot-blood son,</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-282"/>
			<p>Dull blockhead that I was to be so blind, But now my sight is clear ; forgive me, lady.</p>
			<p>Auranthe. My lord, I was a vassal to your frown, And now your favour makes me but more humble ; In wintry winds the simple snow is safe, But fadeth at the greeting of the sun : Unto thine anger I might well have spoken, Taking on me a woman’s privilege, But this so sudden kindness makes me dumb. 30</p>
			<p>Otho. What need of this ? Enough, if you will be A potent tutoress to my wayward boy. And teach him, what it seems his nurse could not, To say, for once, I thank you! Sigifred !</p>
			<p>Albert. He has not yet returned, my gracious liege.</p>
			<p>Otho. What then! No tidings of my friendly Arab ?</p>
			<p>Conrad. None, mighty Otho.</p>
			<p>\^To one of Ms. Knights who goes out. Send forth instantly An hundred horsemen from my honoured gates, To scour the plains and search the cottages. Cry a reward, to him who shall first bring 40</p>
			<p>News of that vanished Arabian, A fuU-heap’d helmet of the purest gold.</p>
			<p>Otho. More thanks, good Conrad ; for, except my son’s, There is no face I rather would behold Than that same quick-eyed pagan’s. By the saints, This coming night of banquets must not light Her dazzling torches ; nor the music breathe Smooth, without clashing cymbal, tones of peace And in-door melodies : nor the ruddy wine Ebb spouting to the lees ; if I pledge not, 50</p>
			<p>In my first cup, that Arab !</p>
			<p>Albert. Mighty Monarch,</p>
			<p>I wonder not this stranger’s victor-deeds So hang upon your spirit. Twice in the fight</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-283"/>
			<p>It was my chance to meet his olive brow, Triumphant in the enemy’s shatter’d rhomb ; And, to say truth, in any Christian arm I never saw such prowess.</p>
			<p>OtJio. Did you ever ?</p>
			<p>O, ‘t is a noble boy !⁠—tut !⁠—what do I say ? I mean a^triple Saladin, whose eyes. When in the glorious scuffle they met mine, 60</p>
			<p>Seem’d to say⁠—‘ Sleep, old man, in safety sleep ; I am the victory !’</p>
			<p>Conrad. Pity he’s not here.</p>
			<p>Otho. And my son too, pity he is not here. Lady Auranthe, I would not make you blush, But can you give a guess where Ludolph is ? Know you not of him ?</p>
			<p>Auranthe. Indeed, my liege, no secret⁠—</p>
			<p>Otho. Nay, nay, without more words, dost know of him ?</p>
			<p>Auranthe. I would I were so over-fortunate, Both for his sake and mine, and to make glad A father’s ears with tidings of his son. 70</p>
			<p>Otho. I see ’tis like to be a tedious day. “Were Theodore and Gonfred and the rest Sent forth with my commands ?</p>
			<p>Albert. Aye, my lord.</p>
			<p>Otlio. And no news ! No news ! ‘Faith ! ‘t is very strange He thus avoids us. Lady, is’t not strange ? Will he be truant to you too ? It is a shame.</p>
			<p>Conrad. Will’t please your highness enter, and accept, The unworthy welcome of your servant’s house ? Leaving your cares to one whose diligence May in few hours make pleasures of them all. 80</p>
			<p>Otho. Not so tedious, Conrad. No, no, no⁠—I must see Ludolph or the⁠—What’s that shout ?</p>
			<p>Voices loithout. Huzza! huzza! Long live the Emperor !</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-284"/>
			<p>Other voices. Fall back ! Away there !</p>
			<p>Otho. Say what noise is that ?</p>
			<p>Albert advancing from the hack of the</p>
			<p>whither he had hastened on hearing the cheers of</p>
			<p>the soldiery.</p>
			<p>Albert. It is young Gersa, the Hungarian prince, Pick’d like a red stag from the fallow herd Of prisoners. Poor prince, forlorn he steps, Slow, and demure, and proud in his despair. If I may judge by his so tragic bearing, His eyes not downcast, and his folded arm, 90</p>
			<p>He doth this moment wish himself asleep Among his fallen captains on yon plains.</p>
			<p>Enter Gersa, in chains, and guarded.</p>
			<p>Otho. Well said. Sir Albert.</p>
			<p>Gersa. Not a word of greeting,</p>
			<p>No welcome to a princely visitor. Most mighty Otho ? Will not my great host Vouchsafe a syllable, before he bids His gentlemen conduct me with all care To some securest lodging⁠—cold perhaps !</p>
			<p>OtTio. What mood is this ? Hath fortune touch’d thy brain ?</p>
			<p>Oersa. O kings and princes of this fev’rous world. What abject things, what mockeries must ye be, loi What nerveless minions of safe palaces ! When here, a monarch, whose proud foot is used To fallen princes’ necks, as to his stirrup, Must needs exclaim that I am mad forsooth, Because I cannot flatter with bent knees My conqueror!</p>
			<p>Otho. Gersa, I think you wrong me :</p>
			<p>I think I have a better fame abroad.</p>
			<p>Oersa. I pr’ythee mock me not with gentle speech, But, as a favour, bid me from thy presence ; no Let me no longer be the wondering food Of all these eyes; pr’ythee command me hence I</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-285"/>
			<p>Otho. Do not mistake me, Gersa. That you may not, Come, fair xliirantlie, try if j^our soft hands Can manage those hard rivets to set free So brave a prince and soldier.</p>
			<p>Auranthe {sets Mm free). Welcome task !</p>
			<p>Gersa. I am woiind up in deep astonishment ! Thank you, fair lady. Otho ! emperor ! You rob me of myself ; my dignity Is now your infant; I am a weak child. 120</p>
			<p>Otiio. Give me your hand, and let this kindly grasp Live in our memories.</p>
			<p>Gersa. In mine it will.</p>
			<p>I blush to think of my unchasten’d tongue ; But I was haunted by the monstrous ghost Of all our slain battalions. Sire, reflect, And pardon you will grant, that, at this hour. The bruised remnants of our stricken camp Are huddling undistinguish’d my dear friends, With common thousands, into shallow graves.</p>
			<p>Otho. Enough, most noble Gersa. You are free 130 To cheer the brave remainder of your host By your own healing presence, and that too. Not as their leader merely, but their king; For, as I hear, the wily enemy. Who eased the crownet from your infant brows. Bloody Taraxa, is among the dead.</p>
			<p>Gersa. Then I retire, so generous Otho please, Bearing with me a weight of benefits Too heavy to be borne.</p>
			<p>OtJio. It is not so ;</p>
			<p>Still understand me, King of Hungary, 140</p>
			<p>Nor judge my open purposes awry. Though I did hold you high in my esteem For your self’s sake, I do not personate The stage-play emperor to entrap applause, To set the silly sort 0’ the world agape.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-286"/>
			<p>And make the politic smile ; no, I have heard How in the Council you condemn’d this war, Urging the perfidy of broken faith⁠—For that I am your friend.</p>
			<p>Gersa. If ever, sire,</p>
			<p>You are my enemy, I dare here swear 150</p>
			<p>‘T will not be Gersa’s fault. Otho, farewell !</p>
			<p>Otho. Will you return, Prince, to our banqueting ?</p>
			<p>Gersa. As to my father’s board I will return.</p>
			<p>Otho. Conrad, with all due ceremony, give The prince a regal escort to his camp; Albert, go thou and bear him company. Gersa, farewell!</p>
			<p>Gersa. All happiness attend you !</p>
			<p>Otho. Return with what good speed you may ; for soon We must consult upon our terms of peace.</p>
			<p>[Exeu?it Gersa and Albert with others. And thus a marble column do I build 160</p>
			<p>To prop my empire’s dome. Conrad, in thee I have another steadfast one, to uphold The portals of my state; and, for my own Pre-eminence and safety, I will strive To keep thy strength upon its pedestal. For, without thee, this day I might have been A show-monster about the streets of Prague, In chains, as j ust now stood that noble prince : And then to me no mercy had been shown. For when the conquer’d lion is once dungeon’d, 170 Who lets him forth again ? or dares to give An old lion sugar-cakes of mild reprieve ? Not to thine ear alone I make confession, But to all here, as, by experience, I know how the great basement of all power Is frankness, and a true tongue to the world ; And how intriguing secrecy is proof Of fear and weakness, and a hollow state. Conrad, I owe thee much.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-287"/>
			<p>Conrad. To kiss that hand,</p>
			<p>My emperor, is ample recompense, 180</p>
			<p>For a mere act of duty.</p>
			<p>Otho. Thou art wrong ;</p>
			<p>For what can any man on earth do more ? We will make trial of your house’s welcome, My bright Auranthe !</p>
			<p>Conrad. How is Friedburg honoured !</p>
			<p>Enter Ethelbert and six Monies.</p>
			<p>Ethelbert. The benison of heaven on your head, Imperial Otho !</p>
			<p>OtJio. Who stays me ? Speak ! Quick !</p>
			<p>Ethelbert. Pause but one moment, mighty conqueror ! Upon the threshold of this house of joy.</p>
			<p>Otho. Pray, do not prose, good Ethelbert, but speak What is your purpose.</p>
			<p>Ethelbert. The restoration of some captive maids. Devoted to Heaven’s pious ministries, 191</p>
			<p>Who, driven forth from their religious cells, And kept in thraldom by our enemy, When late this province was a lawless spoil. Still weep amid the wild Hungarian camp. Though hemm’d around by thy victorious arms.</p>
			<p>Otho. Demand the holy sisterhood in our name From Gersa’s tents. Farewell, old Ethelbert.</p>
			<p>Ethelbert. The saints will bless you for this pious care.</p>
			<p>Otho. Daughter, your hand ; Ludolph’s would fit it best. 200</p>
			<p>Conrad. Ho ! let the music sound !</p>
			<p>{^Music. Ethelbert raises his hands^ as in benediction o/Otho. Exeunt severally. Tlie scene closes on them.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-288"/>
			<p>Scene III. — The Country^ with the Castle in the distance</p>
			<p>Enter Ludolph and Sigifred.</p>
			<p>Ludolph. You have my secret; let it not be breathed.</p>
			<p>Sigifred. Still give me leave to wonder that the Prince Ludolph and the swift Arab are the same; Still to rejoice that’t was a German arm Death doing in a turban’d masquerade.</p>
			<p>Ludolph. The emperor must not know it, Sigifred.</p>
			<p>Sigifred. I pr’ythee, why? What happier hour of time Could thy pleased star point down upon from heaven With silver index, bidding thee make peace ?</p>
			<p>Ludolph. Still it must not be known, good Sigifred ; lo The star may point oblique.</p>
			<p>Sigifred. If Otho knew</p>
			<p>His son to be that unknown Mussulman, After whose spurring heels he sent me forth, With one of.his well-pleased Olympian oaths, The charters of man’s greatness, at this hour He would be watching round the castle walls. And, like an anxious warder, strain his sight For the first glimpse of such a son return’d⁠—Ludolph, that blast of the Hungarians, That Saracenic meteor of the fight, 20</p>
			<p>That silent fury, whose fell scimitar Kept danger all aloof from Otho’s head, And left him space for wonder.</p>
			<p>Ludolph. Say no more.</p>
			<p>Not as a swordsman would I pardon claim. But as a son. The bronzed centurion, Long toil’d in foreign wars, and whose high deeds</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-289"/>
			<p>Are shaded in a forest of tall spears, Known only to his troop, hath greater plea Of favour with my sire than I can have.</p>
			<p>Sigifred. My lord, forgive me that I cannot see How this proud temper with clear reason squares. 31 What made you then, with such an anxious love. Hover around that life, whose bitter days You vext with bad revolt ? Was ‘t opium. Or the mad-fumed wine ? Nay, do not frown, I rather would grieve with you than upbraid.</p>
			<p>Ludolph. I do believe you. No, ‘t was not to make A father his son’s debtor, or to heal His deep heart-sickness for a rebel child. ‘T was done in memory of my boyish days, 40</p>
			<p>Poor cancel for his kindness to my youth, For all his calming of my childish griefs, And all his smiles upon my merriment. No, not a thousand foughten fields could sponge Those days paternal from my memory, Though now upon my head he heaps disgrace.</p>
			<p>Sigifred. My prince, you think too harshly⁠—</p>
			<p>Ludolph. Can I so ?</p>
			<p>Hath he not gall’d my spirit to the quick ? And with a sullen rigour obstinate Pour’d out a phial of wrath upon my faults ? 50</p>
			<p>Hunted me as the Tartar does the boar, Driven me to the very edge o’ the world, And almost put a price upon my head ?</p>
			<p>Sigifred. Remember how he spared the rebel lords.</p>
			<p>Ludolph. Yes, yes, I know he hath a noble nature That cannot trample on the fallen. But his Is not the only proud heart in his realm. He hath wrong’d me, and I have done him wrong ; He hath loved me, and I have shown him kindness; We should be almost equal.</p>
			<p>Yet, for all this, 60</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-290"/>
			<p>I would you had appear’d among those lords, And ta’en his favour.</p>
			<p>Ludolpli. Ha ! till now I thought</p>
			<p>My friend had held poor Ludolph’s honour dear. What ! would you have me sue before his throne > And kiss the courtier’s missal, its silk steps ? Or hug the golden housings of his steed, Amid a camp, whose steeled swarms I dared But yesterday ? And, at the trumpet sound, Bow like some unknown mercenary’s flag And lick the soiled grass ? No, no, my friend, 70 I would not, I, be pardon’d in the heap. And bless indemnity with all that scum⁠—Those men I mean, who on my shoulders propp’d Their weak rebellion, winning me with lies, And pitying forsooth my many wrongs ; Poor self-deceived wretches, who must think Each one himself a king in embryo, Because some dozen vassals cried⁠—my lord ! Cowards, who never knew their little hearts, Till flurried danger held the mirror up, 80</p>
			<p>And then they own’d themselves without a blush, Curling, like spaniels, round my father’s feet. Such things deserted me and are forgiven, While I, less guilty, am an outcast still. And will be, for I love such fair disgrace.</p>
			<p>Sifjifred. I know the clear truth ; so would Otho see. For he is just and noble. Fain would I Be pleader for you⁠—</p>
			<p>LudolpJi. He ’11 hear none of it;</p>
			<p>You know his temper, hot, proud, obstinate; Endanger not yourself so uselessly. 90</p>
			<p>I will encounter his thwart spleen myself. To-day, at the Duke Conrad’s, where he keeps His crowded state after the victory, There will I be, a most unwelcome guest, And parley with him, as a son should do,</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-291"/>
			<p>Who doubly loathes a father’s tyranny ;</p>
			<p>Tell him how feeble is that tyranny ;</p>
			<p>How the relationship of father and son</p>
			<p>Is no more valid than a silken leash</p>
			<p>Where lions tug adverse, if love grow not 100</p>
			<p>From interchanged love through many years.</p>
			<p>Aye, and those turreted Franconian walls,</p>
			<p>Like to a jealous casket, hold my pearl⁠—</p>
			<p>My fair Auranthe ! Yes, I will be there.</p>
			<p>Sigifred. Be not so rash ; wait till his wrath shall pass. Until his royal spirit softly ebbs Self-influenced ; then, in his morning dreams He will forgive thee, and awake in grief To have not thy good morrow.</p>
			<p>Ludolijh. Yes, to-day</p>
			<p>I must be there, while her young pulses beat no Among the new-plumed minions of the war. Have you seen her of late ? No ? Auranthe, Franconia’s fair sister, ’tis I mean. She should be paler for my troublous days⁠—And there it is⁠—my father’s iron lips Have sworn divorcement ’twixt me and my right.</p>
			<p>Sigifred (aside). Auranthe! I had hoped this whim had pass’d.</p>
			<p>Ludol2Jh. And, Sigifred, with all his love of justice. When will he take that grandchild in his arms, That, by my love I swear, shall soon be his ? 120</p>
			<p>This reconcilement is impossible, For see⁠—but who are these ?</p>
			<p>Sigifred. They are messengers</p>
			<p>From our great emperor ; to you, I doubt not, For couriers are abroad to seek you out.</p>
			<p>Enter Theodore and Gonfred. Theodore. Seeing so many vigilant eyes explore The province to invite your highness back To your high dignities, we are too happy.</p>

			<p>ACT II Scene I. — An antechamber in the Castle</p>
			<p>Enter Ludolph and Sigipred.</p>
			<p>Ludolph. No more advices, no more cautioning ; I leave it all to fate⁠—to any thing ! I cannot square my conduct to time, place, Or circumstance : to me ’tis all a mist !</p>
			<p>Sigifred. I say no more.</p>
			<p>Imdolph. It seems I am to wait</p>
			<p>Here in the anteroom ;⁠—that may be a trifle. You see now how I dance attendance here, Without that tyrant temper, you so blame. Snapping the rein. You have medicined me With good advices; and I here remain, 10</p>
			<p>In this most honourable anteroom. Your patient scholar.</p>
			<p>Sigifred. Do not wrong me. Prince.</p>
			<p>By Heavens, I ‘d rather kiss Duke Conrad’s slipper, When in the morning he doth yawn with pride. Than see you humbled but a half-degree! Truth is, the Emperor would fain dismiss The Nobles ere he sees you.</p>
			<p>Enter Gonpred /r6>m the Council-room.</p>

			<p>Gonfred. Great honour to the Prince ! The Emperor,</p>

			<p>Nobles.</p>
			<p>Ludolph. Not the discoloured poisons of a fen. Which he, who breathes, feels warning of his death, Could taste so nauseous to the bodily sense, As these prodigious sycophants disgust The soul’s fine palate.</p>
			<p>Conrad. Princely Ludolph, hail!</p>
			<p>Welcome, thou younger sceptre to the realm ! Strength to thy virgin crownet’s golden buds, That they, against the winter of thy sire. May burst, and swell, and flourish round thy brows, Maturing to a weighty diadem ! 31</p>
			<p>Yet be that hour far off ; and may he live. Who waits for thee, as the chapp’d earth for rain. Set my life’s star! I have lived long enough, Since under my glad roof, propitiously, Father and son each other re-possess.</p>
			<p>Ludolph. Fine wording, Duke ! but words could never yet Forestall the fates ; have you not learnt that yet ? Let me look well: your features are the same ; Your gait the same; your hair of the same shade ; As one I knew some passed weeks ago, 41</p>
			<p>Who sung far different notes into mine ears. I have mine own particular comments on ‘t; You have your own, perhaps.</p>

			<p>And what you soon will learn, I would have turn’d My sword to my own throat, rather than held Its threatening edge against a good King’s quiet : 50 Or with one word fever’d you, gentle Prince, Who seem’d to me, as rugged times then went, Indeed too much oppress’d. May I he bold To tell the Emperor you will haste to him ? Ludolph. Your Dukedom’s privilege will grant so much.</p>
			<p>YExit Conrad. He ‘s very close to Otho, a tight leech ! Your hand⁠—I go ! Ha ! here the thunder comes Sullen against the wind ! If in two angry brows My safety lies, then Sigifred, I ‘m safe. 59</p>
			<p>Enter Otho and Conrad.</p>
			<p>Otho. Will you make Titan play the lackey-page To chattering pigmies ? I would have you know That such neglect of our high Majesty Annuls all feel of kindred. What is son⁠—Or friend⁠—or brother⁠—or all ties of blood⁠—When the whole kingdom, centred in ourself, Is rudely slighted ? Who am I to wait ? By Peter’s chair ! I have upon my tongue A word to fright the proudest spirit here !⁠—Death !⁠—and slow tortures to the hardy fool. Who dares take such large charter from our smiles! Conrad, we would be private ! Sigifred ! 71</p>
			<p>Off ! And none pass this way on pain of death!</p>
			<p>[E.reunt Conrad and Sigifred. Ludolph. This was but half expected, my good sire. Yet I am grieved at it, to the full height, As though my hopes of favour had been whole. Otho. How you indulge yourself ! What can you hope for ? * Ludolph. Nothing, my liege, I have to hope for nothing.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-295"/>
			<p>I come to greet you as a loving son,</p>
			<p>And then depart, if I may be so free,</p>
			<p>Seeing tliat blood of yours in my warm veins 80</p>
			<p>Has not yet mitigated into milk.</p>
			<p>OtJio. What would you, sir ?</p>
			<p>Ludolph. A lenient banishment;</p>
			<p>So please you let me unmolested pass This Conrad’s gates, to the wide air again. I want no more. A rebel wants no more.</p>
			<p>Otho. And shall I let a rebel loose again To muster kites and eagles ’gainst my head ? No, obstinate boy, you shall be kept caged up. Served with harsh food, with scum for Sunday-drink.</p>
			<p>Ludolph. Indeed !</p>
			<p>Otho. And chains too heavy for your life :</p>
			<p>I’ll choose a jailer, whose swart monstrous face 90 Shall be a hell to look upon, and she⁠—</p>
			<p>Ludolph. Ha!</p>
			<p>Otho. Shall be your fair Auranthe.</p>
			<p>Ludolph. Amaze ! Amaze!</p>
			<p>Otho. To-day you marry her.</p>
			<p>Ludolph. This is a sharp jest!</p>
			<p>Otho. No. None at all. When have I said a lie ?</p>
			<p>Ludolph. If I sleep not, I am a waking wretch,</p>
			<p>Otho. Not a word more. Let me embrace my child.</p>
			<p>Ludolph. I dare not. ‘T would pollute so good a father ! O heavy crime ! that your son’s blinded eyes Could not see all his parent’s love aright, 100</p>
			<p>As now I see it. Be not kind to me⁠—Punish me not with favour.</p>
			<p>Otho. Are you sure,</p>
			<p>Ludolph, you have no saving plea in store ?</p>
			<p>Ludolph. My father, none !</p>
			<p>Otho. Thjgn you astonish me.</p>
			<p>Ludolph. No, I have no plea. Disobedience,</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-296"/>
			<p>Rebellion, obstinacy, blasphemy, Are all my counsellors. If they can make My crooked deeds show good and plausible, Then grant^me loving pardon, but not else, Good Gods ! not else, in any way, my liege !</p>
			<p>Otho. You are a most perplexing noble boy. m</p>
			<p>Ludolph. You not less a perplexing noble father.</p>
			<p>Otho. Well, you shall have free passport through the gates. Farewell!</p>
			<p>Ludolph. Farewell! and by these tears believe, And still remember, I repent in pain All my misdeeds !</p>
			<p>Otho. Ludolph, I will ! I will !</p>
			<p>But, Ludolph, ere you go, I would inquire If you in all your wandering, ever met A certain Arab haunting in these parts.</p>
			<p>Ludolph. No, my good lord, I cannot say I did.</p>
			<p>Othx). Make not your father blind before his time; 121</p>
			<p>Nor let these arms paternal hunger more For an embrace, to dull the appetite Of my great love for thee, my supreme child! Come close, and let me breathe into thine ear. I knew you through disguise. You are the Arab! You can’t deny it. {Embracing him,</p>

			<p>What more than I know of could so have changed</p>
			<p>Your purpose touching her.</p>
			<p>OtJio. At a word, this:</p>
			<p>In no deed did you give me more offence Than your rejection of Erminia. To my appalling, I saw too good proof Of your keen-eyed suspicion⁠—she is naught!</p>
			<p>Ludolph. You are convinced ?</p>
			<p>Otlio. Ay, spite of her sweet looks,</p>
			<p>O, that my brother’s daughter should so fall! Her fame has pass’d into the grosser lips Of soldiers in their cups.</p>

			<p>The king⁠—aye, now our king⁠—but still your</p>

			<p>Erminia. Say, is not that a German, yonder ? There !</p>
			<p>Captain. Methinks by his stout bearing he should be⁠—Yes⁠—it is Albert; a brave German knight. And much in the Emperor’s favour.</p>

			<p>Erminia. Truce with that.</p>
			<p>You understand me not; and, in your speech, 40 I see how far the slander is abroad. Without proof could you think me innocent ?</p>

			<p>Erminia. If you have any pity for a maid, Suffering a daily death from evil tongues ; Any compassion for that Emperor’s niece, Who, for your bright sword and clear honesty, Lifted you from the crowd of common men Into the lap of honour ;⁠—save me, knight!</p>

			<p>Scene I. — The Country Enter Albert. Albert. O that the earth were empty, as when Cain Had no perplexity to hide his head ! Or that the sword of some brave enemy Had put a sudden stop to my hot breath, And hurl’d me down the illimitable gulf Of times past, unremember’d ! Better so Than thus fast-limed in a cursed snare, The white limbs of a wanton. This the end Of an aspiring life ! My boyhood past In feud with w^olves and bears, when no eye saw 10 The solitary warfare, fought for love Of honour ‘mid the growling wilderness. My sturdier youth, maturing to the sword, Won by the syren-trumpets, and the ring Of shields upon the pavement, when bright mail’d Henry the Fowler pass’d the streets of Prague. Was ‘t to this end I louted and became The menial of Mars, and held a spear Sway’d by command, as corn is by the wind ? Is it for this, I now am lifted up 20</p>
			<p>By Europe’s throned Emperor, to see My honour be my executioner⁠—My love of fame, my prided honesty Put to the torture for confessional ? Then the damn’d crime of blurting to the world A woman’s secret!⁠—Though a fiend she be, Too tender of my ignominious life ; But then to wrong the generous Emperor In such a searching point, were to give up My soul for foot-ball at Hell’s holiday ! 30</p>

			<p>Albert. You well may laugh and banter. What a fool 40</p>
			<p>An injury may make of a staid man ! You shall know all anon.</p>
			<p>Sigifred. Some tavern brawl ?</p>

			<p>Ludolph. Why has he time to breathe another word ?</p>
			<p>Otho. Ludolph, old Ethelbert, be sure, comes not To beard us for no cause ; he’s not the man To cry himself up an ambassador Without credentials.</p>

			<p>Ludolph. Whither is he winding ?</p>
			<p>Conrad. No clue yet!</p>
			<p>Ethelhert. You have heard, my Liege, and so, no doubt, all here, Foul, poisonous, malignant whisperings ; 130</p>
			<p>Nay open speech, rude mockery grown common, Against the spotless nature and clear fame Of the princess Erminia, your niece. I have intruded here thus suddenly. Because I hold those base weeds, with tight hand, Which now disfigure her fair growing stem, Waiting but for your sign to pull them up By the dark roots, and leave her palpable, To all men’s sight, a lady innocent. The ignominy of that whisper’d tale 140</p>
			<p>About a midnight gallant, seen to climb A window to her chamber neighbour’d near, I will from her turn off, and put the load On the right shoulders ; on that wretch’s head. Who, by close stratagems, did save herself, Chiefly by shifting to this lady’s room A rope-ladder for false witness.</p>
			<p>Ludolph. Most atrocious!</p>
			<p>Otho. Ethelbert, proceed.</p>
			<p>Ethelhert. With sad lips I shall:</p>
			<p>For, in the healing of one wound, I fear To make a greater. His young highness here 150 To-day was married.</p>
			<p>Ludolph. Good.</p>
			<p>Ethelbert. Would it were good !</p>

			<p>Ethelbert. Bold sinner, say you so ?</p>
			<p>Ludolph. Out, hideous monk !</p>
			<p>Otho. Confess, or by the wheel⁠—</p>
			<p>Ethelbert. My evidence cannot be far away ; 161 And, though it never come, be on my head The crime of passing an attaint upon The slanderers of this virgin,</p>

			<p>Ludolph. What shall I do with them ? Something of quick dispatch, for should she hear, My soft Auranthe, her sweet mercy would Prevail against my fury. Damned priest ! 170</p>
			<p>What swift death wilt thou die ? As to the lady, I touch her not.</p>
			<p>Ethelbert. Illustrious Otho, stay !</p>
			<p>An ample store of misery thou hast, Choke not the granary of thy noble mind With more bad bitter grain, too difficult A cud for the repentance of a man Gray-growing. To thee only I appeal, Not to thy noble son, whose yeasting youth Will clear itself, and crystal turn again.

			<p>ACT IV</p>
			<p>Scene I. — Auranthe’s Apartment</p>
			<p>AuRANTHE and Conrad discovered.</p>
			<p>Conrad. Well, well, I know what ugly j eopardy We are caged in ; you need not pester that Into my ears. Pr’ythee, let me be spared A foolish tongue, that I may bethink me Of remedies with some deliberation. You cannot doubt but’t is in Albert’s power To crush or save us ?</p>
			<p>Auranthe. No, I cannot doubt.</p>
			<p>He has, assure yourself, by some strange means. My secret; which I ever hid from him. Knowing his mawkish honesty.</p>
			<p>Conrad. Cursed slave! 10</p>
			<p>Auranthe. Ay, I could almost curse him now myself. Wretched impediment! Evil genius ! A glue upon my wings, that cannot spread, When they should span the provinces ! A snake, A scorpion, sprawling on the first gold step. Conducting to the throne, high canopied.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-316"/>
			<p>Conrad. You would not hear my counsel, when his life Might have been trodden out, all sure and hush’d ; Now the dull animal forsooth must be Intreated, managed ! When can you contrive 20 The interview he demands ?</p>
			<p>Auranthe. As speedily</p>
			<p>It must be done as my bribed woman can Unseen conduct him to me ; but I fear ‘T will be impossible, while the broad day Comes through the panes with persecuting glare. Me thinks, if ‘t now were night I could intrigue With darkness, bring the stars to second me, And settle all this trouble.</p>
			<p>Conrad. Nonsense ! Child !</p>
			<p>See him immediately ; why not now ?</p>
			<p>Auranthe. Do you forget that even the senseless door-posts 30</p>
			<p>Are on the watch and gape through all the house ? How many whisperers there are about, Hungry for evidence to ruin me : Men I have spurn’d, and women I have taunted ? Besides, the foolish prince sends, minute whiles, His pages⁠—so they tell me⁠—to inquire After my health, intreating, if I please, To see me.</p>
			<p>Conrad. Well, suppose this Albert here ; What is your power with him ?</p>
			<p>Auranthe. He should be</p>
			<p>My echo, my taught parrot ! but I fear 40</p>
			<p>He will be cur enough to bark at me ; Have his own say ; read me some silly screed ‘Bout shame and pity.</p>
			<p>Conrad. What will you do then ?</p>
			<p>Auranthe. What I shall do, I know not; what I would Cannot be done ; for see, this chamber-floor</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-317"/>
			<p>Will not yield to the pick-axe and the spade⁠—Here is no quiet depth of hollow ground.</p>
			<p>Conrad. Sister, you have grown sensible and wise, Seconding, ere I speak it, what is now, I hope, resolved between us.</p>
			<p>AurantTu. Say, what is’t ? 50</p>
			<p>Conrad. You need not be his sexton too ; a man May carry that with him shall make him die Elsewhere⁠—give that to him ; pretend the while You will to-morrow succumb to his wishes, Be what they may, and send him from the Castle On some fool’s errand : let his latest groan Frighten the wolves !</p>
			<p>Auranthe. Alas ! he must not die !</p>
			<p>Conrad. Would you were both hearsed up in stifling lead ! Detested⁠—</p>
			<p>Auranthe. Conrad, hold ! I would not bear The little thunder of your fretful tongue, 60</p>
			<p>Tho’ I alone were taken in these toils, And you could free me ; but remember, sir. You live alone in my security : So keep your wits at work, for your own sake, Not mine, and be more mannerly.</p>
			<p>Conrad. Thou wasp !</p>
			<p>If my domains were emptied of these folk. And I had thee to starve⁠—</p>
			<p>Auranthe. O, marvellous!</p>
			<p>But, Conrad, now be gone ; the Host is look’d for; Cringe to the Emperor, entertain the Lords, And, do ye mind, above all things, proclaim 70</p>
			<p>My sickness, with a brother’s sadden’d eye, Condoling with Prince Ludolph. In fit time Return to me.</p>
			<p>Conrad. I leave you to your thoughts. [Exit.</p>
			<p>Auranthe (sola). Down, down, proud temper ! down, Auranthe’s pride !</p>

			<p>Why do I anger him when I should kneel ? Conrad ! Albert ! help ! help ! What can I do ?</p>

			<p>Of a wide empire, like a glowing moon ; 80</p>
			<p>And thou, bright sceptre! lustrous in my eyes⁠—</p>
			<p>There⁠—as the fabled fair Hesperian tree,</p>
			<p>Bearing a fruit more precious ! graceful thing,</p>
			<p>Delicate, godlike, magic ! must I leave</p>
			<p>Thee to melt in the visionary air,</p>
			<p>Ere, by one grasp, this common hand is made</p>
			<p>Imperial ? I do not know the time</p>
			<p>When I have wept for sorrow ; but methinks</p>
			<p>1 could now sit upon the ground, and shed</p>
			<p>Tears, tears of misery ! O, the heavy day ! 90</p>
			<p>How shall I bear my life till Albert comes ?</p>
			<p>Ludolph ! Erminia ? Proofs ! O happy day !</p>
			<p>Bring me some mourning weeds, that I may ‘tire</p>
			<p>Myself, as fits one wailing her own death :</p>
			<p>Cut off these curls, and brand this lily hand.</p>
			<p>And throw these jewels from my loathing sight⁠—</p>
			<p>Fetch me a missal, and a string of beads⁠—</p>
			<p>A cup of bitter’d water, and a crust⁠—</p>
			<p>I will confess, O holy Abbot!⁠—How !</p>
			<p>What is this ? Auranthe ! thou fool, dolt, 100</p>
			<p>Whimpering idiot! up ! up ! and quell!</p>
			<p>I am safe ! Coward ! why am I in fear ?</p>
			<p>Albert ! he cannot stickle, chew the cud</p>
			<p>In such a fine extreme⁠—impossible !</p>
			<p>Who knocks ? [Goes to the door, listens, and opens it.</p>
			<p>Enter Albert. Albert, I have been waiting for you here With such an aching heart, such swooning throbs On my poor brain, such cruel⁠—cruel sorrow. That I should claim your pity ! Art not well ? Albert. Yes, lady, well.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-319"/>
			<p>Auranthe. You look not so, alas!</p>
			<p>But pale, as if you brought some heavy news. m</p>
			<p>Albert. You know full well what makes me look so pale.</p>
			<p>j^urantJie. No ! Do I ? Surely I am still to learn Some horror ; all I know, this present, is I am near hustled to a dangerous gulf, Which you can save me from⁠—and therefore safe, So trusting in thy love ; that should not make Thee pale, my Albert.</p>
			<p>Albert. It doth make me freeze.</p>
			<p>Auranthe. Why should it, love ?</p>
			<p>Albert. You should not ask me that,</p>
			<p>But make your own heart monitor, and save 120</p>
			<p>Me the great pain of telling. You must know.</p>
			<p>Auranthe. Something has vext you, Albert. There are times When simplest things put on a sombre cast; A melancholy mood will haunt a man, Until most easy matters take the shape Of unachievable tasks; small rivulets Then seem impassable.</p>
			<p>Albert. Do not cheat yourself</p>
			<p>With hope that gloss of words, or suppliant action. Or tears, or ravings, or self-threaten’d death, Can alter my resolve.</p>
			<p>Auranthe. You make me tremble; 130</p>
			<p>Not so much at your threats, as at your voice, Untuned, and harsh, and barren of all love.</p>
			<p>Albert. You suffocate me! Stop this devil’s parley. And listen to me ; know me once for all.</p>
			<p>Auranthe. I thought I did. Alas! I am deceived.</p>
			<p>Albert. No, you are not deceived. You took me for A man detesting all inhuman crime ; And therefore kept from me your demon’s plot</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-320"/>
			<p>Against Erminia. Silent ? Be so still;</p>
			<p>For ever ! Speak no more ; but hear my words, 140</p>
			<p>Thy fate. Your safety I have bought to-day</p>
			<p>By blazoning a lie, which in the dawn</p>
			<p>I ’11 expiate with truth.</p>
			<p>Auranthe. O cruel traitor !</p>
			<p>Albert. For I would not set eyes upon thy shame ; I would not see thee dragg’d to death by the hair, Penanced, and taunted on a scaffolding ! To-night, upon the skirts of the blind wood That blackens northward of these horrid towers, I wait for you with horses. Choose your fate. Farewell! 150</p>
			<p>Auranthe. Albert, you jest; I’m sure you must. You, an ambitious Soldier! I, a Queen, One who could say⁠—here, rule these Provinces ! Take tribute from those cities for thyself ! Empty these armouries, these treasuries, Muster thy warlike thousands at a nod! Go! Conquer Italy!</p>

			<p>Auranthe. No more insult, sir !</p>
			<p>Albert. Ay, clutch your scabbard ; but, for prudence sake, Draw not the sword ; ‘t would make an uproar,</p>
			<p>Duke, You would not hear the end of. At nightfall 170 Your lady sister, if I guess aright, Will leave this busy castle. You had best Take farewell too of worldly vanities.</p>
			<p>Conrad. Vassal !</p>

			<p>Otho. O, my poor boy! My son ! My son ! My Ludolph ! Have ye no comfort for me, ye physicians Of the weak body and soul ?</p>
			<p>Ethelbert. ‘T is not in medicine,</p>
			<p>Either of heaven or earth, to cure, unless Fit time be chosen to administer.</p>
			<p>Otho. A kind forbearance, holy Abbot. Come, Erminia ; here, sit by me, gentle girl; Give me thy hand ; hast thou forgiven me ?</p>
			<p>Erminia. Would I were with the saints to pray for you !</p>
			<p>Otho. Why will ye keep me from my darling child ? 10</p>
			<p>Physician. Forgive me, but he must not see thy face.</p>
			<p>Otho. Is then a father’s countenance a Gorgon ? Hath it not comfort in it ? Would it not Console my poor boy, cheer him, help his spirits ? Let me embrace him; let me speak to him ; I will ! Who hinders me ? Who’s Emperor ?</p>
			<p>Physician. You may not. Sire; ’twould overwhelm him quite. He is so full of grief and passionate wrath; Too heavy a sigh would kill him, or do worse. He must be saved by fine contrivances ; 20</p>
			<p>And, most especially, we must keep clear Out of his sight a father whom he loves; His heart is full, it can contain no more, And do its ruddy office.</p>
			<p>Ethelbert. Sage advice;</p>
			<p>We must endeavour how to ease and slacken</p>

			<p>The tight-wound energies of his despair, Not make them tenser.</p>
			<p>Otho. Enough! I hear, I hear;</p>
			<p>Yet you were about to advise more⁠—I listen.</p>
			<p>Et?ielbert. This learned doctor will agree with me, That not in the smallest point should he be thwarted, Or gainsaid by one word ; his very motions, 31</p>
			<p>Nods, becks, and hints, should be obey’d with care. Even on the moment: so his troubled mind May cure itself.</p>
			<p>Physician. There are no other means.</p>

			<p>Physician. Beseech you, Sire, forbear.</p>

			<p>Otho. Let, let me hear his voice; this cannot last: And fain would I catch up his dying words, 40</p>
			<p>Though my own knell they be ! This cannot last! O let me catch his voice⁠—for lo! I hear This silence whisper me that he is dead ! It is so ! Gersa ?</p>

A door in the back scene, guarded by two Soldiers. Lords, Ladies, Knights, Gentlemen, etc., whispering sadly, and ranging themselves; part entering and part discovered.</p>
			<p>\st Knight. Grievously are we tantalized, one and all; Sway’d here and there, commanded to and fro, As though we were the shadows of a sleep. And link’d to a dreaming fancy. What do we here? Qonfred. I am no seer ; you know we must obey The prince from A to Z, though it should be To set the place in flames. I pray, hast heard Where the most wicked Princess is ?</p>
			<p>\8t Knight. There, sir,</p>
			<p>In the next room; have you remark’d those two Stout soldiers posted at the door ?</p>

			<p>Oersa. Put on your brightest looks ; smile if you can ; Behave as all were happy ; keep your eyes From the least watch upon him ; if he speaks To any one, answer collectedly, Without surprise, his questions, howe’er strange. Do this to the utmost⁠—though, alas! with me The remedy grows hopeless ! Here he comes⁠—20 Observe what I have said⁠—show no surprise.</p>
			<p>Enter Ludolph, followed by Sigipred and Page.</p>
			<p>Ludolph. A splendid company! rare beauties here ! I should have Orphean lips, and Plato’s fancy, Amphion’s utterance, toned with his lyre, Or the deep key of Jove’s sonorous mouth. To give fit salutation. Methought I heard, As I came in, some whispers⁠—what of that ? ‘T is natural men should whisper ; at the kiss Of Psyche given by Love, there was a buzz Among the gods !⁠—and silence is as natural. 30</p>
			<p>These draperies are fine, and, being a mortal, I should desire no better ; yet, in truth, There must be some superior costliness, Some wider-domed high magnificence ! I would have, as a mortal I may not, Hangings of heaven’s clouds, purple and gold, Slung from the spheres; gauzes of silver mist, Loop’d up with cords of twisted wreathed light, And tassel’d round with weeping meteors ! These pendent lamps and chandeliers are bright 40 As earthly fires from dull dross can be cleansed ; Yet could my eyes drink up intenser beams</p>

			<p>And spouting exhalations, diamond fires.</p>
			<p>And panting fountains quivering with deep glows !</p>

			<p>We did not tilt each other⁠—that’s a blessing⁠—Good gods ! no innocent blood upon my head !</p>
			<p>Sigifred. Retire, Gersa !</p>
			<p>Ludolph. There should be three more here ;</p>
			<p>For two of them, they stay away perhaps, Being gloomy-minded, haters of fair revels⁠—They know their own thoughts best.</p>
			<p>As for the third. Deep blue eyes, semi-shaded in white lids, Finish’d with lashes fine for more soft shade, 60</p>
			<p>Completed by her twin-arch’d ebon-brows ; White temples, of exactest elegance, Of even mould, felicitous and smooth ; Cheeks fashion’d tenderly on either side. So perfect, so divine, that our poor eyes Are dazzled with the sweet proportioning. And wonder that’t is so⁠—the magic chance ! Her nostrils, small, fragrant, fairy-delicate; Her lips⁠—I swear no human bones e’er wore So taking a disguise ;⁠—you shall behold her ! 70 We ’11 have her presently ; ay, you shall see her, And wonder at her, friends, she is so fair ; She is the world’s chief jewel, and, by heaven, She ‘s mine by right of marriage !⁠—she is mine !</p>

			<p>Ludolph. Ye have none better? No, I am content ; ‘T is a rich sobbing melody, with reliefs Full and majestic ; it is well enough. And will be sweeter, when you see her pace Sweeping into this presence, glistened o’er With emptied caskets, and her train upheld By ladies, habited in robes of lawn. Sprinkled with golden crescents, others bright In silks, with spangles shower’d, and bow’d to By Duchesses and pearled Margravines ! 90</p>
			<p>Sad, that the fairest creature of the earth⁠—I pray yovi mind me not⁠—‘t is sad, I say, That the extremest beauty of the world Should so entrench herself away from me, Behind a barrier of engender’d guilt !</p>

			<p>Soldiers.</p>
			<p>ien. If shame can on a soldier’s vein-swoll’n front Spread deeper crimson than the battle’s toil. Blush in your casing helmets ! for see, see ! Yonder my chivalry, my pride of war, Wrench’d with an iron hand from firm array, Are routed loose about the plashy meads, Of honour forfeit. O, that my known voice Could reach your dastard ears, and fright you more ! Fly, cowards, fly ! Glocester is at your backs ! Throw your slack bridles o’er the flurried manes, Ply well the rowell with faint trembling heels, 10 Scampering to death at last!</p>
			<p>1st Knight. The enemy</p>
			<p>Bears his flaunt standard close upon their rear.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-341"/>
			<p>2d Knight. Sure of a bloody prey, seeing the fens Will swamp them girth-deep.</p>
			<p>Stephen. Over head and ears,</p>
			<p>No matter ! ‘T is a gallant enemy ; How like a comet he goes streaming on. But we must plague him in the flank⁠—hey, friends? We are well breathed⁠—follow !</p>
			<p>Enter Earl Baldwin and Soldiers, as defeated.</p>
			<p>Stephen. De Red vers !</p>
			<p>What is the monstrous bugbear that can fright 20 Baldwin ?</p>
			<p>Baldwin. No scare-crow, but the fortunate star Of boisterous Chester, whose fell truncheon now Points level to the goal of victory. This way he comes, and if you would maintain Your person unaffronted by vile odds. Take horse, my Lord.</p>
			<p>Stephen. And which way spur for life ?</p>
			<p>Now I thank Heaven I am in the toils, That soldiers may bear witness how my arm Can burst the meshes. Not the eagle more Loves to beat up against a tyrannous blast, 30</p>
			<p>Than I to meet the torrent of my foes. This is a brag⁠—be ‘t so⁠—but if I fall, Carve it upon my ‘scutcheon’d sepulchre. On, fellow soldiers ! Earl of Redvers, back ! Not twenty Earls of Chester shall brow-beat The diadem. [Exeunt. Alarum.</p>
			<p>Scene II. — Another part of the Field</p>
			<p>Trumpets sounding a Victory. Enter Glocester, Knights, and Forces. Glocester. Now may we lift our bruised visors up, And take the flattering freshness of the air, While the wide din of battle dies away Into times past, yet to be echoed sure In the silent pages of our chroniclers.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-342"/>
			<p>Ist Knight. Will Stephen’s death be mark’d there,</p>
			<p>my good Lord, Or that we gave him lodging in yon towers ?</p>
			<p>Glocester. Fain would I know the great usurper’s</p>
			<p>fate.</p>
			<p>Enter two Captains severally.</p>
			<p>1st Captain. My Lord !</p>
			<p>2d Captain. Most noble Earl !</p>
			<p>1st Captain. The King⁠—</p>
			<p>2d Captain. The Empress greets⁠—</p>
			<p>Olocester. What of the King ?</p>
			<p>1st Captain. He sole and lone maintains</p>
			<p>A hopeless bustle ‘mid our swarming arms, 12</p>
			<p>And with a nimble savageness attacks, Escapes, makes fiercer onset, then anew Eludes death, giving death to most that dare Trespass within the circuit of his sword ! He must by this have fallen. Baldwin is taken ; And for the Duke of Bretagne, like a stag He flies, for the Welsh beagles to hunt down. 19</p>
			<p>God save the Empress !</p>
			<p>Olocester. Now our dreaded Queen :</p>
			<p>What message from her Highness ?</p>
			<p>M Captain. Royal Maud</p>
			<p>From the throng’d towers of Lincoln hath look’d</p>
			<p>down, Like Pallas from the walls of Ilion, And seen her enemies havock’d at her feet. She greets most noble Glocester from her heart, Entreating him, his captains, and brave knights, To grace a banquet. The high city gates Are envious which shall see your triumph pass; The streets are full of music.</p>
			<p>Enter 2d Knight.</p>
			<p>Olocester. Whence come you ?</p>
			<p>2d Knight. From Stephen, my good Prince⁠—</p>
			<p>Stephen ! Stephen ! 30</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-343"/>
			<p>Glocester. Why do you make such echoing of his</p>
			<p>name ? 2d Knight. Because I think, my lord, he is no man, But a fierce demon, ‘nointed safe from wounds, And misbaptized with a Christian name.</p>
			<p>Glocester. A mighty soldier !⁠—Does he still hold</p>
			<p>out? M Knight. He shames our victory. His valour still Keeps elbow-room amid our eager swords. And holds our bladed falchions all aloof⁠—His gleaming battle-axe being slaughter-sick, Smote on the morion of a Flemish knight, 40</p>
			<p>Broke short in his hand ; upon the which he flung The heft away with such a vengeful force, It paunch’d the Earl of Chester’s horse, who then Spleen-hearted came in full career at him.</p>
			<p>Glocester. Did no one take him at a vantage then? 2d Knight. Three then with tiger leap upon him flew. Whom with his sword swift-drawn and nimbly held. He stung away again, and stood to breathe. Smiling. Anon upon him rush’d once more A throng of foes, and in this renew’d strife, 50</p>
			<p>My sword met his and snapp’d off at the hilt.</p>
			<p>Glocester. Come, lead me to this man⁠—and let us move In silence, not insulting his sad doom With clamorous trumpets. To the Empress bear My salutation as befits the time.</p>
			<p>[Exeunt Glocester and Forces.</p>
			<p>Scene III. — T/ie Field of Battle</p>
			<p>Enter Stephen unarmed.</p>
			<p>Stephen. Another sword ! And what if I could seize</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-344"/>
			<p>One from Bellona’s gleaming armoury, Or choose the fairest of her sheafed spears! Where are my enemies ? Here, close at hand, Here come the testy brood. O, for a sword 1 I ‘m faint⁠—a biting sword ! A noble sword ! A hedge-stake⁠—or a ponderous stone to hurl With brawny vengeance, like the labourer Cain. Come on ! Farewell my kingdom, and all hail Thou superb, plumed, and helmeted renown, lo</p>
			<p>All hail⁠—I would not truck this brilliant day To rule in Pylos with a Nestor’s beard⁠—Come on!</p>
			<p>Enter De Kaims and Knights, etc.</p>
			<p>Be Kaims. Is ‘t madness or a hunger after death That makes thee thus unarm’d throw taunts at</p>
			<p>us V⁠—Yield, Stephen, or my sword’s point dips in The gloomy current of a traitor’s heart.</p>
			<p>Stephen. Do it, De Kaims, I will not budge an inch.</p>
			<p>De Kaims. Yes, of thy madness thou shalt take the meed.</p>
			<p>Stephen. Darest thou ?</p>
			<p>De Kaims. How dare, against a man disarm’d ?</p>
			<p>Stephen. What weapons has the lion but himself ? Come not near me, De Kaims, for by the price 21 Of all the glory I have won this day, Being a king, I will not yield alive To any but the second man of the realm, Robert of Glocester.</p>
			<p>De Kaims. Thou shalt vail to me.</p>
			<p>Stephen. Shall I, when I have sworn against it, sir? Thou think’st it brave to take a breathing king, That, on a court-day bow’d to haughty Maud, The awed presence-chamber may be bold To whisper, there ‘s the man who took alive 30</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-345"/>
			<p>Stephen⁠—me⁠—prisoner. Certes, De Kaims, The ambition is a noble one.</p>
			<p>De Kaims. ‘T is true,</p>
			<p>And, Stephen, I must compass it.</p>
			<p>Stephen. No, no,</p>
			<p>Do not tempt me to throttle you on the gorge. Or with my gauntlet crush your hollow breast. Just when your knighthood is grown ripe and</p>
			<p>full For lordship.</p>
			<p>A Soldier. Is an honest yeoman’s spear Of no use at a need ? Take that.</p>
			<p>Steplien. Ah, dastard !</p>
			<p>De Kaims. What, you are vulnerable ! my prisoner !</p>
			<p>Stephen. No, not yet. I disclaim it, and demand Death as a sovereign right unto a king 41</p>
			<p>Who ‘sdains to yield to any but his peer. If not in title, yet in noble deeds. The Earl of Glocester. Stab to the hilt, De Kaims, For I will never by mean hands be led From this so famous field. Do you hear ! Be quick !</p>
			<p>Trumpets. Enter the Earl of Chester, and Knights.</p>
			<p>Scene IV. — A Presence Chamber. Queen Maud in a Chair of State, the Earls ^Glocester and Chester, Lords, Attendants</p>
			<p>Maud. Glocester, no more: I will behold that Boulogne: Set him before me. Not for the poor sake Of regal pomp and a vain-glorious hour, As thou with wary speech, yet near enough, Hast hinted.</p>
			<p>Glocester. Faithful counsel have I given ; If wary, for your Highness’ benefit.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-346"/>
			<p>Maud. The heavens forbid that I should not think so, For by thy valour have I won this realm, Which by thy wisdom I will ever keep. To sage advisers let me ever bend lo</p>
			<p>A meek attentive ear, so that they treat Of the wide kingdom’s rule and government, Not trenching on our actions personal. Advised, not school’d, I would be ; and henceforth Spoken to in clear, plain, and open terms, Not side-ways sermon’d at.</p>
			<p>Glocester. Then in plain terms,</p>
			<p>Once more for the fallen king⁠—</p>
			<p>Maud. Your pardon. Brother,</p>
			<p>I would no more of that; for, as I said, ’Tis not for worldly pomp I wish to see The rebel, but as dooming judge to give 20</p>
			<p>A sentence something worthy of his guilt.</p>
			<p>Glocester. If ‘t must be so, I ’11 bring him to your presence. \^Exit Glocester.</p>
			<p>Maud. A meaner summoner might do as well⁠—My Lord of Chester, is ‘t true what I hear Of Stephen of Boulogne, our prisoner, That he, as a fit penance for his crimes, Eats wholesome, sweet, and palatable food Off Glocester’s golden dishes⁠—drinks pure wine. Lodges soft ?</p>
			<p>Chester. More than that, my gracious Queen,</p>
			<p>Has anger’d me. The noble Earl, methinks, 30</p>
			<p>Full soldier as he is, and without peer In counsel, dreams too much among his books. It may read well, but sure ’tis out of date To play the Alexander with Darius.</p>
			<p>Maud. Truth! I think so. By Heavens it shall not last!</p>
			<p>Chester. It would amaze your Highness now to mark</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-347"/>
			<p>How Glocester overstrains his courtesy</p>
			<p>To that crime-loving rebel, that Boulogne⁠—</p>
			<p>3faud. That ingrate !</p>
			<p>Chester. For whose vast ingratitude</p>
			<p>To our late sovereign lord, your noble sire, 40</p>
			<p>The generous Earl condoles in his mishaps, And with a sort of lackeying friendliness, Talks off the mighty frowning from his brow Woos him to hold a duet in a smile, Or, if it please him, play an hour at chess⁠—</p>
			<p>Maud. A perjured slave!</p>
			<p>Chester. And for his perjury,</p>
			<p>Glocester has fit rewards⁠—nay, I believe, He sets his bustling household’s wits at work For flatteries to ease this Stephen’s hours, And make a heaven of his purgatory ; 50</p>
			<p>Adorning bondage with the pleasant gloss Of feasts and music, and all idle shows Of indoor pageantry ; while siren whispers, Predestined for his ear, ‘scape as half-check’d From lips the courtliest and the rubiest, Of all the realm, admiring of his deeds.</p>
			<p>Maud. A frost upon his summer!</p>
			<p>Chester. A queen’s nod</p>
			<p>Can make his June December. Here he comes.</p>

			<p>THE EVE OF ST. MARK</p>
			<p>A FRAGMENT</p>
			<p>Upon a Sabbath-day it fell ; Twice holy was the Sabbath-bell, That call’d the folk to evening prayer; The city streets were clean and fair From wholesome drench of April rains ; And, on the western window panes, The chilly sunset faintly told Of unmatured green valleys cold. Of the green thorny bloomless hedge, Of rivers new with spring-tide sedge, Of primroses by shelter’d rills. And daisies on the aguish hills. Twice holy was the Sabbath-bell: The silent streets were crowded well With staid and pious companies. Warm from their fireside orat’ries ; And moving, with demurest air. To even-song, and vesper prayer. Each arched porch, and entry low, Was fill’d with patient folk and slow. With whispers hush, and shuffling feet, While play’d the organ loud and sweet.</p>
			<p>The bells had ceased, the prayers begun, And Bertha had not yet half done A curious volume, patch’d and torn, That all day long, from earliest morn. Had taken captive her two eyes, Among its golden broideries ; Perplex’d her with a thousand things⁠—The stars of Heaven, and angels’ wings, Martyrs in a fiery blaze,</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-349"/>
			<p>Azure saints and silver rays, Moses’ breastplate and the seven, Candlesticks John saw in Heaven, The winged Lion of Saint Mark, And the Covenantal Ark, With its many mysteries. Cherubim and golden mice.</p>
			<p>Bertha was a maiden fair,</p>
			<p>Dwelling in th’ old Minster-square ; 40</p>
			<p>From her fireside she could see.</p>
			<p>Sidelong, its rich antiquity,</p>
			<p>Far as the Bishop’s garden wall;</p>
			<p>Where sycamores and elm-trees tall,</p>
			<p>Full-leaved, the forest had outstript.</p>
			<p>By no sharp north-wind ever nipt,</p>
			<p>So shelter’d by the mighty pile.</p>
			<p>Bertha arose, and read awhile,</p>
			<p>With forehead ’gainst the window-pane.</p>
			<p>Again she tried, and then again, 50</p>
			<p>Until the dusk eve left her dark</p>
			<p>Upon the legend of St, Mark.</p>
			<p>From plaited lawn-frill, fine and thin.</p>
			<p>She lifted up her soft warm chin,</p>
			<p>With aching neck and swimming eyes,</p>
			<p>And dazed with saintly imag’ries.</p>
			<p>All was gloom, and silent all,</p>
			<p>Save now and then the still foot-fall</p>
			<p>Of one returning homewards late,</p>
			<p>Past the echoing minster-gate. 60</p>
			<p>The clamorous daws, that all the day</p>
			<p>Above tree-tops and towers play.</p>
			<p>Pair by pair had gone to rest.</p>
			<p>Each in its ancient belfry-nest.</p>
			<p>Where asleep they fall betimes.</p>
			<p>To music and the drowsy chimes.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-350"/>
			<p>All was silent, all was gloom,</p>
			<p>Abroad and in the homely room:</p>
			<p>Down she sat, poor cheated soul!</p>
			<p>And struck a lamp from the dismal coal; 70</p>
			<p>Lean’d forward, with bright drooping hair</p>
			<p>And slant book, full against the glare.</p>
			<p>Her shadow, in uneasy guise,</p>
			<p>Hover’d about, a giant size,</p>
			<p>On ceiling-beam and old oak chair,</p>
			<p>The parrot’s cage, and panel-square;</p>
			<p>And the warm angled winter-screen,</p>
			<p>On which were many monsters seen,</p>
			<p>Call’d doves of Siam, Lima mice,</p>
			<p>And legless birds of Paradise, 80</p>
			<p>Macaw, and tender Avadavat,</p>
			<p>And silken-f urr ‘d Angora cat.</p>
			<p>Untired she read, her shadow still</p>
			<p>Glower’d about, as it would fill</p>
			<p>The room with wildest forms and shades,</p>
			<p>As though some ghostly queen of spades</p>
			<p>Had come to mock behind her back,</p>
			<p>And dance, and ruffle her garments black.</p>
			<p>Untired she read the legend page,</p>
			<p>Of holy Mark, from youth to age, 90</p>
			<p>On land, on sea, in pagan chains.</p>
			<p>Rejoicing for his many pains.</p>
			<p>Sometimes the learned eremite.</p>
			<p>With golden star, or dagger bright,</p>
			<p>Referr’d to pious poesies</p>
			<p>Written in smallest crow-quill size</p>
			<p>Beneath the text; and thus the rhyme</p>
			<p>Was parcel!’d out from time to time :</p>
			<p>‘ Als writith he of swevenis,</p>

			<p>HYPERION</p>
			<p>A FRAGMENT</p>
			<p>BOOK I</p>
			<p>Deep in the shady sadness of a vale</p>
			<p>Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn,</p>
			<p>Far from the fiery noon, and eve’s one star,</p>
			<p>Sat gray-hair’d Saturn, quiet as a stone.</p>
			<p>Still as the silence round about his lair ;</p>
			<p>Forest on forest hung about his head</p>
			<p>Like cloud on cloud. No stir of air was there.</p>
			<p>Not so much life as on a summer’s day</p>
			<p>Robs not one light seed from the feather’d grass,</p>
			<p>But where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest. k</p>
			<p>A stream went voiceless by, still deadened more</p>
			<p>By reason of his fallen divinity</p>
			<p>Spreading a shade : the Naiad ‘mid her reeds</p>
			<p>Press’d her cold finger closer to her lips.</p>
			<p>Along the margin-sand large foot-marks went. No further than to where his feet had stray’d, And slept there since. Upon the sodden ground His old right hand lay nerveless, listless, dead, Unsceptred ; and his realmless eyes were closed ; While his bow’d head seem’d list’ning to the Earth, His ancient mother, for some comfort yet. 21</p>
			<p>It seem’d no force could wake him from his place: But there came one, who with a kindred hand Touch’d his wide shoulders, after bending low With reverence, though to one who knew it not. She was a Goddess of the infant world ; By her in stature the tall Amazon Had stood a pigmy’s height: she would have ta’en Achilles by the hair and bent his neck ;</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-353"/>
			<p>BOOK FIRST 353</p>
			<p>Or with a finger stay’d Ixion’s wheel. 30</p>
			<p>Her face was large as that of Memphian sphinx,</p>
			<p>Pedestal’d haply in a palace-court,</p>
			<p>When sages look’d to Egypt for their lore.</p>
			<p>But oh ! how unlike marble was that face ;</p>
			<p>How beautiful, if sorrow had not made</p>
			<p>Sorrow more beautiful than Beauty’s self.</p>
			<p>There was a listening fear in her regard,</p>
			<p>As if calamity had but begun ;</p>
			<p>As if the vanward clouds of evil days</p>
			<p>Had spent their malice, and the sullen rear 40</p>
			<p>Was with its stored thunder labouring up.</p>
			<p>One hand she press’d upon that aching spot</p>
			<p>Where beats the human heart, as if just there,</p>
			<p>Though an immortal, she felt cruel pain:</p>
			<p>The other upon Saturn’s bended neck</p>
			<p>She laid, and to the level of his ear</p>
			<p>Leaning with parted lips, some words she spake</p>
			<p>In solemn tenour and deep organ tone :</p>
			<p>Some mourning words, which in our feeble tongue</p>
			<p>Would come in these like accents ; O how frail 50</p>
			<p>To that large utterance of the early gods!</p>
			<p>‘Saturn, look up!⁠—though wherefore, poor old</p>
			<p>King? I have no comfort for thee, no not one : I cannot say, ” O wherefore sleepest thou?” For heaven is parted from thee, and the earth Knows thee not, thus afflicted, for a God ; And ocean too, with all its solemn noise, Has from thy sceptre pass’d ; and all the air Is emptied of thine hoary majesty. Thy thunder, conscious of the new command, 60 Rumbles reluctant o’er our fallen house ; And thy sharp lightning in unpractised hands Scorches and burns our once serene domain. O aching time ! O moments big as years ! All as ye pass swell out the monstrous truth. And press it so upon our weary griefs</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-354"/>
			<p>That unbelief has not a space to breathe.</p>
			<p>Saturn, sleep on :⁠—O thoughtless, why did I</p>
			<p>Thus violate thy slumbrous solitude ?</p>
			<p>Why should I ope thy melancholy eyes ? 70</p>
			<p>Saturn, sleep on ! while at thy feet I weep.’</p>
			<p>As when, upon a tranced summer-night, Those green-robed senators of mighty woods, Tall oaks, branch-charmed by the earnest stars, Dream, and so dream all night without a stir, Save from one gradual solitary gust Which comes upon the silence, and dies off, As if the ebbing air had but one wave : So came these words and went; the while in tears She touch’d her fair large forehead to the ground, 80 Just where her falling hair might be outspread A soft and silken mat for Saturn’s feet. One moon, with alteration slow, had shed Her silver seasons four upon the night. And still these two were postured motionless, Like natural sculpture in cathedral cavern; The frozen God still couchant on the earth, And the sad Goddess weeping at his feet: Until at length old Saturn lifted up His faded eyes, and saw his kingdom gone, 90</p>
			<p>And all the gloom and sorrow of the place. And that fair kneeling Goddess ; and then spake, As with a palsied tongue, and while his beard Shook horrid with such aspen-malady : ‘ O tender spouse of gold Hyperion, Thea, I feel thee ere I see thy face ; Look up, and let me see our doom in it; Look up, and tell me if this feeble shape Is Saturn’s; tell me, if thou hear’st the voice Of Saturn ; tell me, if this wrinkling brow, 100</p>
			<p>Naked and bare of its great diadem, Peers like the front of Saturn. Who had power To make me desolate ? whence came the strength ?</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-355"/>
			<p>How was it nurtured to such bursting forth,</p>
			<p>While Fate seem’d strangled in my nervous grasp ?</p>
			<p>But it is so; and I am smother’d up,</p>
			<p>And buried from all godlike exercise</p>
			<p>Of influence benign on planets pale,</p>
			<p>Of admonitions to the winds and seas,</p>
			<p>Of peaceful sway above man’s harvesting, no</p>
			<p>And all those acts which Deity supreme</p>
			<p>Doth ease its heart of love in. — I am gone</p>
			<p>Away from my own bosom: I have left</p>
			<p>My strong identity, my real self.</p>
			<p>Somewhere between the throne, and where I sit</p>
			<p>Here on this spot of earth. Search, Thea, search !</p>
			<p>Open thine eyes eterne, and sphere them round</p>
			<p>Upon all space : space starr’d, and lorn of light;</p>
			<p>Space region’d with life-air, and barren void ;</p>
			<p>Spaces of fire, and all the yawn of hell. 120</p>
			<p>Search, Thea, search! and tell me if thou seest</p>
			<p>A certain shape or shadow, making way</p>
			<p>With wings or chariot fierce to repossess</p>
			<p>A heaven he lost erewhile: it must⁠—it must</p>
			<p>Be of ripe progress⁠—Saturn must be King.</p>
			<p>Yes, there must be a golden victory ;</p>
			<p>There must be Gods thrown down, and trumpets</p>
			<p>blown Of triumph calm, and hymns of festival Upon the gold clouds metropolitan. Voices of soft proclaim, and silver stir 130</p>
			<p>Of strings in hollow shells ; and there shall be Beautiful things made new, for the surprise Of the sky-children ; I will give command: Thea ! Thea ! Thea ! where is Saturn !</p>
			<p>This passion lifted him upon his feet. And made his hands to struggle in the air, His Druid locks to shake and ooze with sweat, His eyes to fever out, his voice to cease. He stood, and heard not Thea’s sobbing deep;</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-356"/>
			<p>A little time, and then again he snatch’d 140</p>
			<p>Utterance thus :⁠—‘ But cannot I create ?</p>
			<p>Cannot I form ? Cannot I fashion forth</p>
			<p>Another world, another universe,</p>
			<p>To overbear and crumble this to nought ?</p>
			<p>Where is another chaos ? Where ?’⁠—That word</p>
			<p>Found way unto Olympus, and made quake</p>
			<p>The rebel three. — Thea was startled up,</p>
			<p>And in her bearing was a sort of hope,</p>
			<p>As thus she quick-voiced spake, yet full of awe.</p>
			<p>‘ This cheers our fallen house : come to our friends,</p>
			<p>0 Saturn ! come away, and give them heart; 151</p>
			<p>1 know the covert, for thence came I hither.’ Thus brief; then with beseeching eyes she went With backward footing through the shade a space: He follow’d, and she turn’d to lead the way Through aged boughs, that yielded like the mist Which eagles cleave upmounting from their nest.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile in other realms big tears were shed, More sorrow like to this, and such like woe, Too huge for mortal tongue or pen of scribe: 160 The Titans fierce, self-hid, or prison-bound Groan’d for the old allegiance once more. And listen’d in sharp pain for Saturn’s voice. But one of the whole mammoth-brood still kept His sov’reignty, and rule, and majesty ; Blazing Hyperion on his orbed fire Still sat, still snuff’d the incense, teeming up From man to the sun’s God ; yet unsecm-e: For as among us mortals omens drear Fright and perplex, so also shudder’d he, 170</p>
			<p>Not at dog’s howl, or gloom-bird’s hated screech. Or the familiar visiting of one Upon the first toll of his passing-bell. Or prophesyings of the midnight lamp : But horrors, portion’d to a giant nerve,</p>

			<p>Oft made Hyperion ache. His palace bright Bastion’d with pyramids of glowing gold, And touch’d with shade of bronzed obelisks, Glared a blood-red through all its thousand courts, Arches, and domes, and fiery galleries ; i8o</p>
			<p>And all its curtains of Aurorian clouds Flush’d angerly : while sometimes eagles’ wings, Unseen before by Gods or wondering men, Darken’d the place ; and neighing steeds were heard, Not heard before by Gods or wondering men. Also, when he would taste the spicy wreaths. Of incense breathed aloft from sacred hills, Instead of sweets, his ample palate took Savour of poisonous brass and metal sick: And so, when harbour’d in the sleepy west, 190</p>
			<p>After the full completion of fair day, For rest divine upon exalted couch And slumber in the arms of melody. He paced away the pleasant hours of ease With stride colossal, on from hall to hall; While far within each aisle and deep recess, His winged minions in close clusters stood, Amazed and full of fear ; like anxious men Who on wide plains gather in panting troops, When earthquakes jar their battlements and towers. 200 Even now while Saturn, roused from icy trance. Went step for step with Thea through the woods, Hyperion, leaving twilight in the rear, Came slope upon the threshold of the west; Then, as was wont, his palace-door flew ope In smoothest silence, save what solemn tubes, Blown by the serious Zephyrs, gave of sweet And wandering sounds, slow-breathed melodies ; And like a rose in vermeil tint and shape. In fragrance soft, and coolness to the eye, 210 That inlet to severe magnificence Stood full blown, for the God to enter in.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-358"/>
			<p>He enter’d, but he enter’d full of wrath, His flaming robes stream’d out beyond his heels, And gave a roar, as if of earthly fire, That scared away the meek ethereal Hours And made their dove-wings tremble. On he flared From stately nave to nave, from vault to vault, Through bowers of fragrant and enwreathed light. And diamond-paved lustrous long arcades 220</p>
			<p>Until he reach’d the great main cupola ; There standing fierce beneath, he stampt his foot. And from the basements deep to the high towers Jarr’d his own golden region : and before The quavering thunder thereupon had ceased, His voice leapt out, despite of godlike curb, To this result: ‘ O dreams of day and night ! O monstrous forms ! O effigies of pain! O spectres busy in a cold, cold gloom !</p>
			<p>0 lank-ear’d Phantoms of black-weeded pools ! 230 Why do I know ye ? why have I seen ye ! why</p>
			<p>Is my eternal essence thus distraught</p>
			<p>To see and to behold these horrors new ?</p>
			<p>Saturn is fallen, am I too to fall ?</p>
			<p>Am I to leave this haven of my rest.</p>
			<p>This cradle of my glory, this soft clime,</p>
			<p>This calm luxuriance of blissful light.</p>
			<p>These crystalline pavilions, and pure fanes,</p>
			<p>Of all my lucent empire ? It is left</p>
			<p>Deserted, void, nor any haunt of mine. 240</p>
			<p>The blaze, the splendour, and the symmetry,</p>
			<p>1 cannot see⁠—but darkness, death and darkness. Even here, into my centre of repose.</p>
			<p>The shady visions come to domineer.</p>
			<p>Insult, and blind, and stifle up my pomp. —</p>
			<p>Fall !⁠—No, by Tellus and her briny robes!</p>
			<p>Over the fiery frontier of my realms</p>
			<p>I will advance a terrible right arm</p>
			<p>Shall scare that infant thunderer, rebel Jove,</p>
			<p>And bid old Saturn take his throne again.’ 250</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-359"/>
			<p>He spake, and ceased, the while a heavier threat Held struggle with his throat, but came not forth ; For as in theatres of crowded men Hubbub increases more they call out, ‘ Hush 1 So at Hyperion’s words the Phantoms pale Bestirr’d themselves, thrice horrible and cold ; And from the mirror’d level where he stood A mist arose, as from a scummy marsh. At this, through all his bulk an agony Crept gradual, from the feet unto the crown, 260 Like a lithe serpent vast and muscular Making slow way, with head and neck convulsed From over-strained might. Released, he fled To the eastern gates, and full six dewy hours Before the dawn in season due should blush. He breathed fierce breath against the sleepy portals, Clear’d them of heavy vapours, burst them wide Suddenly on the ocean’s chilly streams. The planet orb of fire, whereon he rode Each day from east to west the heavens through, 270 Spun round in sable curtaining of clouds: Not therefore veiled quite, blindfold, and hid, But ever and anon the glancing spheres, Circles, and arcs, and broad-belting colure, Glow’d through, and wrought upon the muffling</p>
			<p>dark Sweet-shaped lightnings from the nadir deep Up to the zenith⁠—hieroglyphics old. Which sages and keen-eyed astrologers Then living on the earth, with labouring thought Won from the gaze of many centuries : 280</p>
			<p>Now lost, save what we find on remnants huge Of stone, or marble swart; their import gone. Their wisdom long since fled. — Two wings this</p>
			<p>orb Possess’d for glory, two fair argent wings, Ever exalted at the God’s approach :</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-360"/>
			<p>And now, from forth the gloom their plumes immense Rose, one by one, till all outspreaded were ; While still the dazzling globe maintain’d eclipse, Awaiting for Hyperion’s command. Fain would he have commanded, fain took throne And bid the day begin, if but for change. 291</p>
			<p>He might not:⁠—No, though a primeval God The sacred seasons might not be disturb’d. Therefore the operations of the dawn Stay’d in their birth, even as here ‘t is told. Those silver wings expanded sisterly, Eager to sail their orb ; the porches wide Open’d upon the dusk demesnes of night; And the bright Titan, phrenzied with new woes, Unused to bend, by hard compulsion bent 300</p>
			<p>llis spirit to the sorrow of the time : And all along a dismal rack of clouds, Upon the boundaries of day and night, He stretch’d himself in grief and radiance faint. There as he lay, the Heaven with its stars Look’d down on him with pity, and the voice Of Coelus, from the universal space. Thus whisper’d low and solemn in his ear : * O brightest of my children dear, earth-born And sky-engendered. Son of Mysteries 310</p>
			<p>All unrevealed even to the powers Which met at thy creating ; at whose joys And palpitations sweet, and pleasures soft, I, Coelus, wonder, how they came and whence ; And at the fruits thereof what shapes they be, Distinct, and visible ; symbols divine, Manifestations of that beauteous life Diffused unseen throughout eternal space : Of these new-form’d art thou, oh brightest child ! Of these, thy brethren and the Goddesses! 320</p>
			<p>There is sad feud among ye, and rebellion Of son against his sire. I saw him fall,</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-361"/>
			<p>I saw my first-born tumbled froDi his throne ! To me his arms were spread, to me his voice Found way from forth the thunders round his</p>
			<p>head! Pale wox I, and in vapours hid my face. Art thou, too, near such doom ? vague fear there</p>
			<p>is: For I have seen my sons most unlike Gods. Divine ye were created, and divine In sad demeanour, solemn, undisturb’d, 330</p>
			<p>Unruffled, like high Gods, ye lived and ruled : Now I behold in you fear, hope, and wrath ; Actions of rage and passion ; even as I see them, on the mortal world beneath. In men who die. — This is the grief, O Son ! Sad sign of ruin, sudden dismay, and fall! Yet do thou strive ; as thou art capable. As thou canst move about, an evident God; And canst oppose to each malignant hour Ethereal presence :⁠—I am but a voice ; 340</p>
			<p>My life is but the life of winds and tides, No more than winds and tides can I avail :⁠—But thou canst. — Be thou therefore in the van Of circumstance ; yea, seize the arrow’s barb Before the tense string murmur. — To the earth ! For there thou wilt find Saturn, and his woes. Meantime I wi’ll keep watch on thy bright sun, And of thy seasons be a careful nurse.’⁠—Ere half this region-whisper had come down, Hyperion arose, and on the stars 350</p>
			<p>Lifted his curved lids, and kept them wide Until it ceased ; and still he kept them wide ; And still they were the same bright, patient stars. Then with a slow incline of his broad breast, Like to a diver in the pearly seas, Forward he stoop’d over the airy shore. And plunged all noiseless into the deep night.</p>

			<p>BOOK II</p>
			<p>Just at the self-same beat of Time’s wide wings</p>
			<p>Hyperion slid into the rustled air,</p>
			<p>And Saturn gain’d with Thea that sad place</p>
			<p>Where Cybele and the bruised Titans mourn’d.</p>
			<p>It was a den where no insulting light</p>
			<p>Could glimmer on their tears ; where their own</p>
			<p>groans They felt, but heard not, for the solid roar Of thunderous waterfalls and torrents hoarse, Pouring a constant bulk, uncertain where. Crag jutting forth to crag, and rocks that seem’d 10 Ever as if just rising from a sleep, Forehead to forehead held their monstrous horns ; And thus in thousand hugest phantasies Made a fit roofing to this nest of woe. Instead of thrones, hard flint they sat upon, Couches of rugged stone, and slaty ridge Stubborn’d with iron. All were not assembled : Some chain’d in torture, and some wandering. Coeus, and Gyges, and Briarciis, Typhon, and Dolor, and Porphyrion, 20</p>
			<p>With many more, the brawniest in assault, Were pent in regions of laborious breath ; Dungeon’d in opaque element to keep Their clenched teeth still clench’d, and all their</p>
			<p>limbs Lock’d up like veins of metal, crampt and screw’d ; Without a motion, save of their big hearts Heaving in pain, and horribly convulsed With sanguine, feverous, boiling gurge of pulse. Mnemosyne was straying in the world ; Far from her moon had Phoebe wandered; 30</p>
			<p>And many else were free to roam abroad. But for the main, here found they covert drear. Scarce images of life, one here, one there,</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-363"/>
			<p>Lay vast and edgeways ; like a dismal cirque</p>
			<p>Of Druid stones, upon a forlorn moor,</p>
			<p>When the chill rain begins at shut of eve,</p>
			<p>In dull November, and their chancel vault,</p>
			<p>The Heaven itself, is blinded throughout night.</p>
			<p>Each one kept shroud, nor to his neighbour gave</p>
			<p>Or word, or look, or action of despair. 40</p>
			<p>Crelis was one ; his ponderous iron mace</p>
			<p>Lay by him, and a shatter’d rib of rock</p>
			<p>Told of his rage, ere he thus sank and pined.</p>
			<p>lapetus another ; in his grasp,</p>
			<p>A serpent’s plashy neck ; its barbed tongue</p>
			<p>Squeezed from the gorge, and all its uncurl’d length</p>
			<p>Dead ; and because the creature could not spit</p>
			<p>Its poison in the eyes of conquering Jove.</p>
			<p>Next Cottus: prone he lay, chin uppermost,</p>
			<p>As though in pain : for still upon the flint 50</p>
			<p>He ground severe his skull, with open mouth</p>
			<p>And eyes at horrid working. Nearest him</p>
			<p>Asia, born of most enormous Caf,</p>
			<p>Who cost her mother Tellus keener pangs,</p>
			<p>Though feminine, than any of her sons :</p>
			<p>More thought than woe was in her dusky face,</p>
			<p>For she was prophesying of her glory ;</p>
			<p>And in her wide imagination stood</p>
			<p>Palm-shaded temples, and high rival fanes,</p>
			<p>By Oxus or in Ganges’ sacred isles. 60</p>
			<p>Even as Hope upon her anchor leans.</p>
			<p>So leant she, not so fair, upon a tusk</p>
			<p>Shed from the broadest of her elephants.</p>
			<p>Above her, on a crag’s uneasy shelve.</p>
			<p>Upon his elbow raised, all prostrate else,</p>
			<p>Shadow’d Enceladus ; once tame and mild</p>
			<p>As grazing ox unworried in the meads;</p>
			<p>Now tiger-passion’d, lion-thoughted, wroth,</p>
			<p>He meditated, plotted, and even now</p>
			<p>Was hurling mountains in that second war, 70</p>
			<p>Not long delay’d, that scared the younger Gods</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-364"/>
			<p>To hide themselves in forms of beast and bird. Not far hence Atlas ; and beside him prone Phorcus, the sire of Gorgons. Neighbour’d close Oceanus, and Tethys, in whose lap Sobb’d Clymene among her tangled hair. In midst of all lay Themis, at the feet Of Ops the queen all clouded round from sight; No shape distinguishable, more than when Thick night confounds the pine - tops with the clouds: 80</p>
			<p>And many else whose names may not be told. For when the Muse’s wings are air-ward spread, Who shall delay her flight ? And she must chant Of Saturn, and his guide, who now had climb’d With damp and slippery footing from a depth More horrid still. Above a sombre cliff Their heads appear’d, and up their stature grew Till on the level height their steps found ease : Then Thea spread abroad her trembling arms Upon the precincts of this nest of pain, 90</p>
			<p>And side-long fix’d her eye on Saturn’s face : There saw she direst strife ; the supreme God At war with all the frailty of grief. Of rage, of fear, anxiety, revenge. Remorse, spleen, hope, but most of all despair. Against these plagues he strove in vain: for Fate Had pour’d a mortal oil upon his head, A disanointing poison : so that Thea, Affrighted, kept her still, and let him pass First onwards in, among the fallen tribe. 100</p>
			<p>As with us mortal men, the laden heart Is persecuted more, and fever’d more. When it is nighing to the mournful house Where other hearts are sick of the same bruise ; So Saturn, as he walk’d into the midst, Felt faint, and would have sunk among the rest, But that he met Enceladus’s eye,</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-365"/>
			<p>“Whose mightiness, and awe of him, at once Came like an inspiration; and he shouted, 109</p>
			<p>‘ Titans, behold your God !’ at which some groan’d ; Some started on their feet; some also shouted ; Some wept, some wail’d⁠—all bow’d with reverence ; And Ops, uplifting her black folded veil. Show’d her pale cheeks, and all her forehead wan, Her eyebrows thin and jet, and hollow eyes. There is a roaring in the bleak-grown pines When Winter lifts his voice ; there is a noise Among immortals when a God gives sign. With hushing finger, how he means to load His tongue with the full weight of utterless thought, With thunder, and with music, and with pomp : 121 Such noise is like the roar of bleak-grown pines ; Which, when it ceases in this mountain’d world, No other sound succeeds ; but ceasing here. Among these fallen, Saturn’s voice therefrom Grew up like organ, that begins anew Its strain, when other harmonies, stopt short, Leave the dinn’d air vibrating silverly. Thus grew it up :⁠—‘ Not in my own sad breast, Which is its own great judge and searcher out, 130 Can I find reason why ye should be thus: Not in the legends of the first of days. Studied from that old spirit-leaved book Which starry Uranus with finger bright Saved from the shores of darkness, when the waves Low-ebb’d still hid it up in shallow gloom ;⁠—And the which book ye know I ever kept For my firm-based footstool:⁠—Ah, infirm! Not there, nor in sign, symbol, or portent Of element, earth, water, air, and fire⁠—140</p>
			<p>At war, at peace, or inter-quarrelling One against one, or two, or three, or all Each several one against the other three, As fire with air loud warring when rain-floods</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-366"/>
			<p>Drown both, and press them both against earth’s</p>
			<p>face, Where, finding sulphur, a quadruple wrath Unhinges the poor world ;⁠—not in that strife, Wherefrom I take strange lore, and read it deep, Can I find reason why ye should be thus : No, nowhere can unriddle, though I search, 150</p>
			<p>And pore on nature’s universal scroll Even to swooning, why ye. Divinities, The first-born of all shaped and palpable Gods, Should cower beneath what, in comparison, Is untremendous might. Yet ye are here, O’erwhelm’d, and spurn’d, and batter’d, ye are here ! O Titans, shall I say ” Arise! ”⁠—Ye groan : Shall I say ” Crouch ! ”⁠—Ye groan. What can I</p>
			<p>then? O Heaven wide ! O unseen parent dear ! What can I ? Tell me, all ye brethren Gods, 160 How we can war, how engine our great wrath!</p>
			<p>0 speak your counsel now, for Saturn’s ear Is all a-hunger’d. Thou, Oceanus, Ponderest high and deep ; and in thy face</p>
			<p>1 see, astonied, that severe content</p>
			<p>Which comes of thought and musing: give us help!’</p>
			<p>So ended Saturn; and the God of the Sea, Sophist and Sage, from no Athenian grove, But cogitation in his watery shades. Arose, with locks not oozy, and began, 170</p>
			<p>In murmurs, which his first-endeavouring tongue Caught infant-like from the far-foamed sands. ‘ O ye, whom wrath consumes ! who, passion-stung, Writhe at defeat, and nurse your agonies! Shut up your senses, stifle up your ears, My voice is not a bellows unto ire. Yet listen, ye who will, whilst I bring proof How ye, perforce, must be content to stoop ;</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-367"/>
			<p>And in the proof much comfort will I give,</p>
			<p>If ye will take that comfort in its truth. 180</p>
			<p>We fall by course of Nature’s law, not force</p>
			<p>Of thunder, or of Jove. Great Saturn, thou</p>
			<p>Has sifted well the atom-universe ;</p>
			<p>But for this reason, that thou art the King,</p>
			<p>And only blind from sheer supremacy,</p>
			<p>One avenue was shaded from thine eyes.</p>
			<p>Through which I wander’d to eternal truth.</p>
			<p>And first, as thou wast not the first of powers.</p>
			<p>So art thou not the last ; it cannot be ;</p>
			<p>Thou art not the beginning nor the end. 190</p>
			<p>From chaos and parental darkness came</p>
			<p>Light, the first fruits of that intestine broil,</p>
			<p>That sullen ferment, which for wondrous ends</p>
			<p>Was ripening in itself. The ripe hour came,</p>
			<p>And with it light, and light engendering</p>
			<p>Upon its own producer, forthwith touch’d</p>
			<p>The whole enormous matter into life.</p>
			<p>Upon that very hour, our parentage.</p>
			<p>The Heavens and the Earth, were manifest:</p>
			<p>Then thou first-born, and we the giant-race, 200</p>
			<p>Found ourselves ruling new and beauteous realms.</p>
			<p>Now comes the pain of truth, to whom ‘t is pain ;</p>
			<p>O folly ! for to bear all naked truths.</p>
			<p>And to envisage circumstance, all calm,</p>
			<p>That is the top of sovereignty. Mark well!</p>
			<p>As Heaven and Earth are fairer, fairer far</p>
			<p>Than Chaos and blank Darkness, though once chiefs ;</p>
			<p>And as we show beyond that Heaven and Earth</p>
			<p>In form and shape compact and beautiful,</p>
			<p>In will, in action free, companionship, 210</p>
			<p>And thousand other signs of purer life;</p>
			<p>So on our heels a fresh perfection treads,</p>
			<p>A power more strong in beauty, born of us</p>
			<p>And fated to excel us, as we pass</p>
			<p>In glory that old Darkness : nor are we</p>
			<p>Thereby more conquer’d, than by us the rule</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-368"/>
			<p>Of shapeless Chaos. Say, doth the dull soil</p>
			<p>Quarrel with the proud forests it hath fed,</p>
			<p>And feedeth still, more comely than itself ?</p>
			<p>Can it deny the chiefdom of green groves ? 220</p>
			<p>Or shall the tree be envious of the dove</p>
			<p>Because it cooeth, and hath snowy wings</p>
			<p>To wander wherewithal and find its joys ?</p>
			<p>We are such forest-trees, and our fair boughs</p>
			<p>Have bred forth, not pale solitary doves,</p>
			<p>But eagles golden-feather’d, who do tower</p>
			<p>Above us in their beauty, and must reign</p>
			<p>In right thereof ; for ’tis the eternal law</p>
			<p>That first in beauty should be first in might:</p>
			<p>Yea, by that law, another race may drive 230</p>
			<p>Our conquerors to mourn as we do now.</p>
			<p>Have ye beheld the young God of the Seas,</p>
			<p>My dispossessor ? Have ye seen his face ?</p>
			<p>Have ye beheld his chariot, foam’d along</p>
			<p>By noble winged creatures he hath made ?</p>
			<p>I saw him on the calmed waters scud.</p>
			<p>With such a glow of beauty in his eyes,</p>
			<p>That it enforced me to bid sad farewell</p>
			<p>To all my empire ; farewell sad I took.</p>
			<p>And hither came, to see how dolorous fate 240</p>
			<p>Had wrought upon ye ; and how I might best</p>
			<p>Give consolation in this woe extreme.</p>
			<p>Receive the truth and let it be your balm.’</p>
			<p>Whether through poz’d conviction, or disdain They guarded silence, when Oceanus Left murmuring, what deepest thought can tell ? But so it was, none answer’d for a space, Save one whom none regarded, Clymene : And yet she answer’d not, only complain’d, With hectic lips, and eyes up-looking mild, 250</p>
			<p>Thus wording timidly among the fierce : ‘ O Father, I am here the simplest voice, And all my knowledge is that joy is gone.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-369"/>
			<p>And this thing woe crept in among our hearts,</p>
			<p>There to remain forever, as I fear :</p>
			<p>I would not bode of evil, if I thought</p>
			<p>So weak a creature could turn off the help</p>
			<p>Which by just right should come of mighty Gods ;</p>
			<p>Yet let me tell my sorrow, let me tell</p>
			<p>Of what I heard, and how it made me weep, 260</p>
			<p>And know that we had parted from all hope.</p>
			<p>I stood upon a shore, a pleasant shore,</p>
			<p>Where a sweet clime was breathed from a land</p>
			<p>Of fragrance, quietness, and trees, and flowers.</p>
			<p>Full of calm joy it was, as I of grief;</p>
			<p>Too full of joy and soft delicious warmth ;</p>
			<p>So that I felt a movement in my heart</p>
			<p>To chide, and to reproach that solitude</p>
			<p>With songs of misery, music of our woes ;</p>
			<p>And sat me down, and took a mouthed shell 270</p>
			<p>And murmur’d into it, and made melody⁠—</p>
			<p>0 melody no more ! for while I sang,</p>
			<p>And with poor skill let pass into the breeze The dull shell’s echo, from a bowery strand Just opposite, an island of the sea, There came enchantment with the shifting wind, That did both drown and keep alive my ears.</p>
			<p>1 threw my shell away upon the sand. And a wave fill’d it, as my sense was fiU’d</p>
			<p>With that new blissful golden melody. 280</p>
			<p>A living death was in each gush of sounds.</p>
			<p>Each family of rapturous hurried notes.</p>
			<p>That fell, one after one, yet all at once,</p>
			<p>Like pearl beads dropping sudden from their string :</p>
			<p>And then another, then another strain.</p>
			<p>Each like a dove leaving its olive perch,</p>
			<p>With music wing’d instead of silent plumes.</p>
			<p>To hover round my head, and make me sick</p>
			<p>Of joy and grief at once. Grief overcame.</p>
			<p>And I was stopping up my frantic ears, 290</p>
			<p>When, past all hindrance of my trembling hands.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-370"/>
			<p>A voice came sweeter, sweeter than all tune, And still it cried, “Apollo ! young Apollo ! The morning-bright Apollo ! young Apollo ! ” I fled, it foUow’d me, and cried, ” Apollo !” O Father, and O Brethren, had ye felt Those pains of mine ; O Saturn, hadst thou felt, Ye would not call this too indulged tongue Presumptuous, in thus venturing to be heard.’</p>
			<p>So far her voice flow’d on, like timorous brook 300 That, lingering along a pebbled coast, Doth fear to meet the sea : but sea it met. And shudder’d ; for the overwhelming voice Of huge Enceladus swallow’d it in wrath : The ponderous syllables, like sullen waves In the half-glutted hollows of reef-rocks, Came booming thus, while still upon his arm He lean’d ; not rising, from supreme contempt.</p>
			<p>• Or shall we listen to the over-wise,</p>
			<p>Or to the over-foolish giant, Gods? 310</p>
			<p>Not thunderbolt on thunderbolt, till all</p>
			<p>That rebel Jove’s whole armoury were spent.</p>
			<p>Not world on world upon these shoulders piled,</p>
			<p>Could agonize me more than baby-words</p>
			<p>In midst of this dethronement horrible.</p>
			<p>Speak ! roar ! shout! yell ! ye sleepy Titans all.</p>
			<p>Do ye forget the blows, the buffets vile ?</p>
			<p>Are ye not smitten by a youngling arm ?</p>
			<p>Dost thou forget, sham Monarch of the Waves,</p>
			<p>Thy scalding in the seas ? What! have I roused 320</p>
			<p>Your spleens with so few simple words as these ?</p>
			<p>O joy ! for now I see ye are not lost :</p>
			<p>O joy ! for now I see a thousand eyes</p>
			<p>Wide-glaring for revenge.’⁠—As this he said,</p>
			<p>He lifted up his stature vast, and stood,</p>
			<p>Still without intermission speaking thus:</p>
			<p>* Now ye are flames, I ’11 tell you how to burn, And purge the ether of our enemies ;</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-371"/>
			<p>How to feed fierce the crooked stings of fire,</p>
			<p>And singe away the swollen clouds of Jove, 330</p>
			<p>Stifling that puny essence in its tent,</p>
			<p>O let him feel the evil he hath done ;</p>
			<p>For though I scorn Oceanus’slore,</p>
			<p>Much pain have I for more than loss of realms :</p>
			<p>The days of peace and slumberous calm are fled ;</p>
			<p>Those days, all innocent of scathing war,</p>
			<p>When all the fair Existences of heaven</p>
			<p>Came open-eyed to guess what we would speak:⁠—</p>
			<p>That was before our brows were taught to frown,</p>
			<p>Before our lips knew else but solemn sounds ; 340</p>
			<p>That was before we knew the winged thing.</p>
			<p>Victory, might be lost, or might be won.</p>
			<p>And be ye mindful that Hyperion,</p>
			<p>Our brightest brother, still is undisgraced⁠—</p>
			<p>Hyperion, lo ! his radiance is here !’</p>
			<p>All eyes were on Enceladus’s face. And they beheld, while still Hyperion’s name Flew from his lips up to the vaulted rocks, A pallid gleam across his features stern : Not savage, for he saw full many a God 350</p>
			<p>Wroth as himself. He look’d upon them all, And in each face he saw a gleam of light, But splendider in Saturn’s, whose hoar locks Shone like the bubbling foam about a keel When the prow sweeps into a midnight cove. In pale and silver silence they remain’d, Till suddenly a splendour, like the morn, Pervaded all the beetling gloomy steeps, All the sad spaces of oblivion.</p>
			<p>And every gulf, and every chasm old, 360</p>
			<p>And every height, and every sullen depth, Voiceless, or hoarse with loud tormented streams : And all the everlasting cataracts. And all the headlong torrents far and near, Mantled before in darkness and huge shade,</p>

			<p>Golden his hair of short Numidian curl,</p>
			<p>Regal his shape majestic, a vast shade</p>
			<p>In midst of his own brightness, like the bulk</p>
			<p>Of Memnon’s image at the set of sun</p>
			<p>To one who travels from the dusking East:</p>
			<p>Sighs, too, as mournful as that Memnon’s harp,</p>
			<p>He utter’d, while his hands contemplative</p>
			<p>He press’d together, and in silence stood.</p>
			<p>Despondence seized again the fallen Gods</p>
			<p>At sight of the dejected King of Day, 380</p>
			<p>And many hid their faces from the light:</p>
			<p>But fierce Enceladus sent forth his eyes</p>
			<p>Among the brotherhood ; and, at their glare,</p>
			<p>Uprose lapetus, and Creus too,</p>
			<p>And Phorcus, sea-born, and together strode</p>
			<p>To where he tower’d on his eminence.</p>
			<p>There those four shouted forth old Saturn’s name;</p>
			<p>Hyperion from the peak loud answered ‘ Saturn !’</p>
			<p>Saturn sat near the Mother of the Gods,</p>
			<p>In whose face was no joy, though all the Gods 390</p>
			<p>Gave from their hollow throats the name of * Saturn !’</p>

			<p>Beside the osiers of a rivulet,</p>

			<p>The nightingale had ceased, and a few stars</p>
			<p>Were lingering in the heavens, while the thrush</p>
			<p>Began calm-throated. Throughout all the isle</p>
			<p>There was no covert, no retired cave</p>
			<p>Unhaunted by the murmurous noise of waves, 40</p>
			<p>Though scarcely heard in many a green recess.</p>
			<p>He listen’d, and he wept, and his bright tears</p>
			<p>Went trickling down the golden bow he held.</p>
			<p>Thus with half-shut suffused eyes he stood.</p>
			<p>While from beneath some cumbrous boughs hard by</p>

			<p>Or hath that antique mien and robed form</p>
			<p>Moved in these vales invisible till now ?</p>
			<p>Sure I have heard those vestments sweeping o’er</p>
			<p>The fallen leaves, when I have sat alone</p>
			<p>In cool mid-forest. Surely I have traced</p>
			<p>The rustle of those ample skirts about</p>

			<p>Lift up their heads, and still the whisper pass’d.</p>
			<p>Goddess ! I have beheld those eyes before,</p>
			<p>And their eternal calm, and all that face, 60</p>

From the young day when first thy infant hand Pluck’d witless the weak flowers, till thine arm Could bend that bow heroic to all times. Show thy heart’s secret to an ancient Power Who hath forsaken old and sacred thrones For prophecies of thee, and for the sake Of loveliness new-born.’⁠—Apollo then. With sudden scrutiny and gloomless eyes, 80</p>
			<p>Thus answer’d, while his white melodious throat Throbb’d with the syllables :⁠—‘ Mnemosyne ! Thy name is on my tongue, I know not how ; Why should I tell thee what thou so well seest ?</p>

			<p>To any one particular beauteous star, 100</p>
			<p>And I will flit into it with my lyre,</p>
			<p>And make its silvery splendour pant with bliss.</p>
			<p>I have heard the cloudy thunder: Where is power?</p>
			<p>Whose hand, whose essence, what divinity</p>
			<p>Makes this alarum in the elements.</p>
			<p>While I here idle listen on the shores</p>

			<p>Unintellectiial, yet divine to me;⁠—Divine, I say !⁠—Wliat sea-bird o’er tlie sea Is a philosopher the while he goes Winging along where the great water throes ?</p>
			<p>How shall I do</p>
			<p>To get anew Those moulted feathers, and so mount once more</p>
			<p>Above, above</p>
			<p>The reach of fluttering Love, And make him cower lowly while I soar ? Shall I gulp wine ? No, that is vulgarism, A heresy and schism.</p>
			<p>Foisted into the canon law of love ;⁠—No⁠—wine is only sweet to happy men ;</p>
			<p>More dismal cares</p>
			<p>Seize on me unawares⁠—Where shall I learn to get my piece again ?-To banish thoughts of that most hateful land, Dungeoner of my friends, that wicked strand Where they were wreck’d and live a wrecked life; That monstrous region, whose dull rivers pour, Ever from their sordid urns unto the shore, Unown’d of any weedy-haired gods ; Whose winds, all zephyrless, hold scourging rods. Iced in the great lakes, to afiiict mankind ; Whose rank-grown forests, frosted, black, and blind, Would fright a Dryad; whose harsh herbaged</p>
			<p>meads Make lean and lank the starved ox while he feeds; There bad flowers have no scent, birds no sweet</p>

			<p>THE CAP AND BELLS</p>
			<p>OR, THE JEALOUSIES</p>
			<p>A Faery Tale. Unfinished</p>
			<p>In midmost Ind, beside Hydaspes cool,</p>
			<p>There stood, or hover’d, tremulous in the air,</p>
			<p>A faery city, ’neath the potent rule</p>
			<p>Of Emperor Elfinan; fam’d ev’rywhere</p>
			<p>For love of mortal women, maidens fair.</p>
			<p>Whose lips were solid, whose soft hands were</p>
			<p>made Of a fit mould and beauty, ripe and rare, To pamper his slight wooing, warm yet staid : He loved girls smooth as shades, but hated a mere</p>
			<p>shade.</p>
			<p>This was a crime forbidden by the law ;</p>
			<p>And all the priesthood of his city wept.</p>
			<p>For ruin and dismay they well foresaw.</p>
			<p>If impious prince no bound or limit kept.</p>
			<p>And faery Zendervester overstept;</p>
			<p>They wept, he sinn’d, and still he would sin on,</p>
			<p>They dreamt of sin, and he sinn’d while they</p>
			<p>slept ; In vain the pulpit thunder’d at the throne, Caricature was vain, and vain the tart lampoon.</p>
			<p>Which seeing, his high court of parliament Laid a remonstrance at his Highness’ feet, Praying his royal senses to content Themselves with what in faery land was sweet. Befitting best that shade with shade should meet Whereat, to calm their fears, he promised soon</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-383"/>
			<p>From mortal tempters all to make retreat⁠—Ay, even on the first of the new moon, An immaterial wife to espouse as heaven’s boon.</p>
			<p>Meantime he sent a fluttering embassy To Pigmio, of Imaus sovereign, To half beg, and half demand, respectfully, The hand of his fair daughter Bellanaine ; An audience had, and speeching done, they gain Their point, and bring the weeping bride away; Whom, with but one attendant, safely lain Upon their wings, they bore in bright array, While little harps were touch’d by many a lyric fay.</p>
			<p>As in old pictures tender cherubim A child’s soul thro’ the sapphired canvas bear, So, thro’ a real heaven, on they swim With the sweet princess on her plumaged lair, Speed giving to the winds her lustrous hair ; And so she journey’d, sleeping or awake, Save when, for healthful exercise and air, She chose to ‘ promener a I’aile,’ or take A pigeon’s somerset, for sport or change’s sake.</p>
			<p>‘Dear Princess, do not whisper me so loud,’ Quoth Corallina, nurse and confidant, ‘ Do not you see there, lurking in a cloud, Close at your back, that sly old Crafticant ? He hears a whisper plainer than a rant: Dry up your tears, and do not look so blue ; He ‘s Elfinan’s great state-spy militant. He’s running, lying, flying footman, too⁠—Dear mistress, let him have no handle against you !</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-384"/>

			<p>‘ Show him a mouse’s tail, and he will guess, With metaphysic swiftness, at the mouse ; Show him a garden, and with speed no less, He ’11 surmise sagely of a dwelling-house, And plot, in the same minute, how to chouse The owner out of it; show him a⁠—’ ‘ Peace ! Peace ! nor contrive thy mistress’ ire to rouse !’ Return’d the princess, ‘ my tongue shall not cease Till from this hated match I get a free release.</p>
			<p>VIII</p>
			<p>‘ Ah, beauteous mortal!’ ‘ Hush !’ quoth Coralline, ‘Really you must not talk of him indeed.’ * You hush !’ replied the mistress, with a shine Of anger in her eyes, enough to breed In stouter hearts than nurse’s fear and dread : ‘T was not the glance itself made nursey flinch, But of its threat she took the utmost heed; Not liking in her heart an hour-long pinch, Or a sharp needle run into her back an inch.</p>
			<p>IX</p>
			<p>So she was silenced, and fair Bellanaine, Writhing her little body with ennui, Continued to lament and to complain. That Fate, cross-purposing, should let her be Ravish’d away, far from her dear countree ; That all her feelings should be set at nought. In trumping up this match so hastily. With lowland blood; and lowland blood she thought Poison, as every stanch true-born Imaian ought.</p>
			<p>X</p>
			<p>Sorely she grieved, and wetted three or four White Provence rose-leaves with her faery tears.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-385"/>
			<p>But not for this cause ;⁠—alas ! she had more Bad reasons for her sorrow, as appears In the famed memoirs of a thousand years, Written by Crafticant, and published By Parpaglion and Co., (those sly compeers Who raked up ev’ry fact against the dead,) In Scarab Street, Panthea, at the Jubal’s Head.</p>
			<p>Where, after a long hypercritic howl Against the vicious manners of the age. He goes on to expose, with heart and soul. What vice in this or that year was the rage, Backbiting all the world in every page ; With special strictures on the horrid crime, (Section’d and subsection’d with learning sage,) Of faeries stooping on their wings sublime To kiss a mortal’s lips, when such were in their prime.</p>
			<p>Turn to the copious index, you will find Somewhere in the column, headed letter B, The name of Bellanaine, if you ‘re not blind; Then pray refer to the text, and you will see An article made up of calumny Against this highland princess, rating her For giving way, so over fashionably. To this new-fangled vice, which seems a burr Stuck in his moral throat, no coughing e’er could stir.</p>
			<p>XIII</p>
			<p>There he says plainly that she loved a man ! That she around him flutter’d, flirted, toy’d. Before her marriage with great Elfinan; That after marriage too, she never joy’d In husband’s company, but still employ’d Her wits to ‘scape away to Angle-land ;</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-386"/>
			<p>Where lived the youth, who worried and annoy’d Her tender heart, and its warm ardours fann’d To such a dreadful blaze, her side would scorch her hand.</p>
			<p>XIV</p>
			<p>But let us leave this idle tittle-tattle To waiting-maids, and bed-room coteries, Nor till fit time against her fame wage battle. Poor Elfinan is very ill at ease, Let us resume his subject if you please : For it may comfort and console him much, To rhyme and syllable his miseries ; Poor Elfinan! whose cruel fate was such. He sat and cursed a bride he knew he could not touch.</p>

			<p>Soon as (according to his promises) The bridal embassy had taken wing. And vanish’d, bird-like, o’er the suburb trees. The emperor, empierced with the sharp sting Of love, retired, vex’d and murmuring Like any drone shut from the fair bee-queen, Into his cabinet, and there did fling His limbs upon the sofa, full of spleen. And damn’d his House of Commons, in complete chagrin.</p>

			<p>‘I’ll trounce some of the members,’ cried the</p>

			<p>So said, one minute’s while his eyes remain’d Half lidded, piteous, languid, innocent; But, in a wink, their splendour they regain’d, Sparkling revenge with amorous fury blent. Love thwarted in bad temper oft has vent : He rose, he stampt his foot, he rang the bell, And order’d some death-warrants to be sent For signature :⁠—somewhere the tempest fell, As many a poor fellow does not live to tell.</p>

			<p>These orders given, the Prince, in half a pet, Let o’er the silk his propping elbow slide,</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-389"/>
			<p>Caught up his little legs, and, in a fret, Fell on the sofa on his royal side, The slave retreated backwards, humble-eyed, And with a slave-like silence closed the door, And to old Hum thro’ street and alley hied ; He ‘ knew the city,’ as we say, of yore, And for short cuts and turns, w^as nobody knew more.</p>

			<p>It was the time when wholesale dealers close Their shutters with a moody sense of wealth, But retail dealers, diligent, let loose The gas (objected to on score of health), Convey’d in little solder’d pipes by stealth, And make it flare in many a brilliant form, That all the powers of darkness it repell’th. Which to the oil-trade doth great scaith and harm, And supersedeth quite the use of the glow-worm.</p>
			<p>Eban, untempted by the pastry-cooks,</p>
			<p>(Of pastry he got store within the palace,)</p>
			<p>With hasty steps, wrapp’d cloak, and solemn looks,</p>
			<p>Incognito upon his errand sallies.</p>
			<p>His smelling-bottle ready for the allies ;</p>
			<p>He pass’d the hurdy-gurdies with disdain,</p>
			<p>Vowing he ‘d have them sent on board the gal</p>
			<p>leys; Just as he made his vow, it ‘gan to rain. Therefore he call’d a coach, and bade it drive amain.</p>
			<p>‘I’ll pull the string,’ said he, and further said, ‘ Polluted Jarvey ! Ah, thou filthy hack ! Whose springs of life are all dried up and dead. Whose linsey-woolsey lining hangs all slack, Whose rug is straw, whose wholeness is a crack</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-390"/>
			<p>And evermore thy steps go clatter-clitter; Whose glass once up can never be got back, Who prov’st, with jolting arguments and bitter, That’t is of modern use to travel in a litter.</p>
			<p>‘ Thou inconvenience ! thou hungry crop For all corn ! thou snail-creeper to and fro, Who while thou goest ever seem’st to stop, And fiddle-faddle standest while you go ; I’ the morning, freighted with a weight of woe, Unto some lazar-house thou journeyest, And in the evening tak’st a double row Of dowdies for some dance or party drest, Besides the goods meanwhile thou movest east and west.</p>
			<p>XXVIII</p>
			<p>‘ By thy ungallant bearing and sad mien, An inch appears the utmost thou couldst budge : Yet at the slightest nod, or hint, or sign, Round to the curb-stone patient dost thou trudge, School’d in a beckon, learned in a nudge, A dull-eyed Argus watching for a fare; Quiet and plodding thou dost bear no grudge To whisking tilburies, or phaetons rare, Curricles, or mail-coaches, swift beyond compare.’</p>
			<p>Philosophizing thus, he pull’d the check. And bade the coachman wheel to such a street, Who turning much his body, more his neck, Louted full low, and hoarsely did him greet: ‘ Certes, Monsieur were best take to his feet. Seeing his servant can no farther drive For press of coaches, that to-night here meet. Many as bees about a straw-capp’d hive, When first for April honey into faint flowers they dive.’</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-391"/>
			<p>XXX</p>
			<p>Eban then paid his fare, and tiptoe went To Hum’s hotel; and, as he on did pass With head inclined, each dusky lineament Show’d in the pearl-paved street as in a glass ; His purple vest, that ever peeping was Rich from the fluttering crimson of his cloak, His silvery trowsers, and his silken sash Tied in a burnish’d knot, their semblance took Upon the mirror’d walls, wherever he might look.</p>
			<p>XXXI</p>
			<p>He smiled at self, and, smiling, show’d his teeth, And seeing his white teeth, he smiled the more; Lifted his eyebrows, spurn’d the path beneath, Show’d teeth again, and smiled as heretofore. Until he knock’d at the magician’s door ; “Where, till the porter answer’d, might be seen. In the clear panel more he could adore⁠—His turban wreathed of gold, and white, and green, Mustachios, ear-ring, nose-ring, and his sabre keen.</p>
			<p>‘ Does not your master give a rout to-night ?’ Quoth the dark page; ‘ Oh, no !’ return’d the</p>
			<p>Swiss, ‘ Next door but one to us, upon the right. The Magazin des Modes now open is Against the Emperor’s wedding;⁠—and, sir, this My master finds a monstrous horrid bore ; As he retired, an hour ago iwis, With his best beard and brimstone, to explore And cast a quiet figure in his second floor.</p>
			<p>XXXIII</p>
			<p>‘ Gad ! he ‘s obliged to stick to business! For chalk, I hear, stands at a pretty price ;</p>

			<p>XXXV</p>
			<p>It was indeed the great Magician,</p>
			<p>Feeling, with careful toe, for every stair.</p>
			<p>And retrograding careful as he can.</p>
			<p>Backwards and downwards from his own two</p>
			<p>pair: ‘ Salpietro !’ exclaimed Hum, ‘ is the dog there ? He’s always in my way upon the mat!’ * He ‘s in the kitchen, or the Lord knows</p>
			<p>where,’⁠—Replied the Swiss⁠—‘ the nasty, yelping brat!’ ‘ Don’t beat him !’ return’d Hum, and on the floor</p>
			<p>came pat.</p>
			<p>XXXVI</p>
			<p>Then facing right about, he saw the Page,</p>
			<p>And said ; ‘ Don’t tell me what you want, Eban ;-</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-393"/>
			<p>The Emperor is now in a huge rage⁠—’Tis nine to one he’ll give you the rattan ! Let us away !’ Away together ran The plain-dress’d sage and spangled blackamoor, Nor rested till they stood to cool, and fan, And breathe themselves at th’ Emperor’s chamber door. When Eban thought he heard a soft imperial snore.</p>
			<p>XXXVII</p>
			<p>• I thought you guess’d, foretold, or prophesied, That’s Majesty was in a raving fit?’ ‘ He dreams,’ said Hum, ‘ or I have ever lied. That he is tearing you, sir, bit by bit.’ *He ‘s not asleep, and you have little wit,’ Replied the Page, ‘ that little buzzing noise, Whate’er your palmistry may make of it. Comes from a plaything of the Emperor’s choice. From a Man-Tiger-Organ, prettiest of his toys.’</p>
			<p>XXXVIII</p>
			<p>Eban then usher’d in the learned Seer: Elfinan’s back was turn’d, but, ne’ertheless, Both, prostrate on the carpet, ear by ear, Crept silently, and waited in distress, Knowing the Emperor’s moody bitterness; Eban especially, who on the floor ‘gan Tremble and quake to death⁠—he feared less A dose of senna-tea, or nightmare Gorgon, Than the Emperor when he play’d on his Man-Tiger-Organ.</p>
			<p>They kiss’d nine times the carpet’s velvet face Of glossy silk, soft, smooth, and meadow-green. Where the close eye in deep rich fur might trace A silver tissue, scantly to be seen. As daisies lurk’d in June-grass, buds in green ;</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-394"/>
			<p>Sudden the music ceased, sudden the hand Of majesty, by dint of passion keen, Doubled into a common fist, went grand, And knock’d down three cut glasses, and his best ink-stand.</p>
			<p>Then turning round, he saw those trembling two: ‘Eban,’ said he, ‘ as slaves should taste the fruits Of diligence, I shall remember you To-morrow, or next day, as time suits, In a finger conversation with my mutes⁠—Begone !⁠—for you, Chaldean ! here remain ! Fear not, quake not, and as good wine recruits A conjurer’s spirits, what cup will you drain? Sherry in silver, hock in gold, or glass’d champagne ?’</p>
			<p>* Commander of the Faithful!’ answer’d Hum, In preference to these, I ’11 merely taste</p>
			<p>A thimble-full of old Jamaica rum,’</p>
			<p>* A simple boon !’ said Elfinan, ‘ thou may’st Have Nantz, with which my morning-coffee’s</p>
			<p>laced,‘1 ‘ I ’11 have a glass of Nantz, then⁠—said the Seer⁠—</p>
			<p>* Made racy⁠—(sure my boldness is misplaced !)⁠—With the third part⁠—(yet that is drinking</p>
			<p>dear!)⁠—Of the least drop of creme de citron crystal clear.’</p>
			<p>XLII</p>
			<p>* I pledge you. Hum ! and pledge my dearest love, My Bertha !’ ‘ Bertha ! Bertha I’ cried the sage,</p>
			<p>» ‘Mr, Nisby is of opinion that laced coffee is bad for the head.’⁠—Spectator.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-395"/>
			<p>‘ I know a many Berthas !’ ‘ Mine’s above All Berthas ! ‘ sighed the Emperor. * I engage,’ Said Hum, ‘ ia duty, and in vassalage, To mention all the Berthas in the earth ;⁠—There’s Bertha Watson⁠—and Miss Bertha</p>
			<p>Page⁠—This famed for languid eyes, and that for mirth⁠—There ‘s Bertha Blount of York⁠—and Bertha Knox</p>
			<p>of Perth.’</p>
			<p>‘You seem to know’⁠—‘I do know,’ answer’d</p>
			<p>Hum, •Your Majesty ‘s in love with some fine girl Named Bertha; but her surname will not come, Without a little conjuring.’ ‘ ‘T is Pearl, ’Tis Bertha Pearl ! What makes my brain so</p>
			<p>whirl V And she is softer, fairer than her name !’ ‘ Where does she live ?’ ask’d Hum. ‘ Her fair</p>
			<p>locks curl So brightly, they put all our fays to shame !⁠—Live ?⁠—O! at Canterbury, with her old grand</p>
			<p>dame.’</p>
			<p>‘ Good ! good !’ cried Hum, ‘ I ‘ve known her</p>
			<p>from a child ! She is a changeling of my management; She was born at midnight in an Indian wild ; Her mother’s screams with the striped tiger’s</p>
			<p>blent. While the torch-bearing slaves a halloo sent Into the jungles ; and her palanquin, Rested amid the desert’s dreariment, Shook with her agony, till fair were seen The little Bertha’s eyes ope on the stars serene,’</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-396"/>
			<p>‘I can’t say,’ said the monarch, ‘that may be Just as it happen’d, true or else a bam ! Drink up your brandy, and sit down by me, Feel, feel my pulse, how much in love I am ; And if your science is not all a sham, Tell me some means to get the lady here.’ ‘ Upon my honour !’ said the son of Cham.i ‘ She is my dainty changeling, near and dear. Although her story sounds at first a little queer.’</p>
			<p>‘ Convey her to me, Hum, or by my crown,</p>
			<p>My sceptre, and my cross-surmounted globe,</p>
			<p>I’ll knock you⁠—’ ‘Does your majesty mean⁠—</p>
			<p>down f No, no, you never could my feelings probe To such a depth !’ The Emperor took his robe, And wept upon its purple palatine, While Hum continued, shamming half a sob⁠—‘ In Canterbury doth your lady shine ? But let me cool your brandy with a little wine.’</p>
			<p>XLVII</p>
			<p>Whereat a narrow Flemish glass he took, That since belong’d to Admiral De Witt, Admired it with a connoisseuring look. And with the ripest claret crowned it, And, ere the lively head could burst and flit, He turn’d it quickly, nimbly upside down, His mouth being held conveniently fit To catch the treasure : ‘Best in all the town !’ He said, smack’d his moist lips, and gave a pleasant frown.</p>
			<p>1 Cham is said to have been the inventor of magic. Lucy learnt this from Bayle’s Dictionary, and had copied a long Latin note from that work.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-397"/>
			<p>XLVIII</p>
			<p>* Ah ! good my Prince, weep not!’ And then</p>
			<p>again He fill’d a bumper. ‘ Great Sire, do not weep ! Your pulse is shocking, but I’ll ease your pain.’ ‘ Fetch me that Ottoman, and prithee keep Your voice low,’ said the Emperor, ‘ and steep Some lady’s-fingers nice in Candy wine ; And prithee. Hum, behind the screen do peep For the rose-water vase, magician mine ! And sponge my forehead⁠—so my love doth make me pine.’</p>
			<p>XLIX</p>
			<p>‘ Ah, cursed Bellanaine !’ ‘ Don’t think of her,’ . Rejoin’d the Mago, ‘ but on Bertha muse ; For, by my choicest best barometer, You shall not throttled be in marriage noose; I ‘ve said it. Sire ; you only have to choose Bertha or Bellanaine.’ So saying, he drew From the left pocket of his threadbare hose, A sampler hoarded slyly, good as new ; Holding it by his thumb and finger full in view.</p>
			<p>‘ Sire, this is Bertha Pearl’s neat handywork, Her name, see here. Midsummer, ninety-one’⁠—Elfinan snatch’d it with a sudden jerk, And wept as if he never would have done. Honouring with royal tears the poor homespun ; Whereon were broider’d tigers with black eyes, And long-tailed pheasants, and a rising sun, Plenty of posies, great stags, butterflies Bigger than stags⁠—a moon⁠—with other mysteries.</p>
			<p>The monarch handled o’er and o’er again These day-school hieroglyphics with a sigh;</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-398"/>
			<p>Somewhat in sadness, but pleased in the main,</p>
			<p>Till this oracular couplet met his eye</p>
			<p>Astounded⁠—Cupid, I do thee defy !</p>
			<p>It was too much. He shrunk back in his chair,</p>
			<p>Grew pale as death and fainted⁠—very nigh !</p>
			<p>‘ Pho ! nonsense !’ exclaim’d Hum, ‘ now don’t</p>
			<p>despair : She does not mean it really. Cheer up, hearty⁠—</p>
			<p>there!</p>
			<p>‘ And listen to my words. You say you won’t,</p>
			<p>On any terms, marry Miss Bellanaine ;</p>
			<p>It goes against your conscience⁠—good 1 well,</p>
			<p>don’t. You say, you love a mortal. I would fain Persuade your honour’s highness to refrain From peccadilloes. But, Sire, as I say, What good would that do ? And, to be more</p>
			<p>plain, You would do me a mischief some odd day. Cut off my ears and hands, or head too, by my fay !</p>
			<p>‘ Besides, manners forbid that I should pass any Vile strictures on the conduct of a prince Who should indulge his genius, if he has any, Not, like a subject, foolish matter mince. Now I think on ‘t, perhaps I could convince Your Majesty there is no crime at all In loving pretty little Bertha, since She’s very delicate⁠—not over tall⁠—A fairy’s hand, and in the waist why⁠—very small.’</p>
			<p>‘Eing the repeater, gentle Hum !’ * ‘T is five,’ Said gentle Hum ; ‘ the nights draw in apace ; The little birds I hear are all alive;</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-399"/>
			<p>I see the dawning touch’d upon your face ; Shall I put out the candles, please your Grace ?’ ‘ Do put them out, and, without more ado, Tell me how I may that sweet girl embrace⁠—How you can bring her to me.’ * That’s for you. Great Emperor 1 to adventure, like a lover true.’</p>
			<p>LV</p>
			<p>= * I fetch her !’⁠—‘ Yes, an’t like your Majesty ; And as she would be frighten’d wide awake, To travel such a distance through the sky, Use of some soft manoeuvre you must make. For your convenience, and her dear nerves’ sake ; Nice Way would be to bring her in a swoon, Anon, I ’11 tell you what course were best to take ; You must away this morning.’ ‘ Hum ! so soon ?’</p>
			<p>* Sire, you must be in Kent by twelve o’clock at noon.’</p>
			<p>At this great Csesar started on his feet. Lifted his wings, and stood attentivewise. Those wings to Canterbury you must beat, If you hold Bertha as a worthy prize. Look in the Almanack⁠—Moore never lies⁠—April the twenty-fourth⁠—this coming day. Now breathing its new bloom upon the skies, Will end in St. Mark’s Eve ;⁠—you must away, For on that eve alone can you the maid convey.’</p>
			<p>LVII</p>
			<p>Then the magician solemnly ‘gan to frown, So that his frost-white eye-brows, beetling low, Shaded his deep green eyes, and wrinkles brown Plaited upon his furnace-scorched brow : Forth from his hood that hung his neck below He lifted a bright casket of pure gold, Touch’d a spring-lock, and there in wool or snow,</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-400"/>
			<p>Charm’d into ever freezing, lay an old And legend- leaved book, mysterious to behold.</p>
			<p>LVIII</p>
			<p>‘ Take this same book⁠—it will not bite you, Sire; There, put it underneath your royal arm ; Though it’s a pretty weight, it will not tire, But rather on your journey keep you warm: This is the magic, this the potent charm, That shall drive Bertha to a fainting fit! When the time comes, don’t feel the least alarm But lift her from the ground, and swiftly flit Back to your palace</p>
			<p>LIX</p>
			<p>* What shall I do with that same book ?’ ‘ Why</p>
			<p>merely Lay it on Bertha’s table, close beside Her work-box, and ‘t will help your purpose</p>
			<p>dearly; I say no more.’ ‘ Or good or ill betide. Through the wide air to Kent this morn I glide !’ Exclaim’d the Emperor, ‘ When I return. Ask what you will⁠—I ’11 give you my new</p>
			<p>bride ! And take some more wine. Hum;⁠—O, Heavens!</p>
			<p>I burn To be upon the wing 1 Now, now, that minx I</p>
			<p>spurn !’</p>
			<p>LX</p>
			<p>* Leave her to me,’ rejoin’d the magian :</p>
			<p>‘ But how shall I account, illustrious fay ! For thine imperial absence ? Pho ! I can Say you are very sick, and bar the way To your so loving courtiers for one day ; If either of their two Archbishops’ graces</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-401"/>
			<p>Should talk of extreme unction, I shall say You do not like cold pig with Latin phrases, Which never should be used but in alarming cases.’</p>
			<p>LXI</p>
			<p>* Open the window. Hum ; I ‘m ready now!’ ‘ Zooks!’ exclaim’d Hum, as up the sash he drew, ‘Behold, your Majesty, upon the brow Of yonder hill, what crowds of people !’ ‘ Whew! The monster’s always after something new,’ Return’d his Highness, ‘they are piping hot To see my pigsney Bellanaine. Hum ! do Tighten my belt a little⁠—so, so⁠—not Too tight⁠—the book !⁠—my wand !⁠—so, nothing is forgot.’</p>
			<p>* Wounds ! how they shout !’ said Hum, ‘ and</p>
			<p>there⁠—see, see, Th’ ambassador’s return’d from Pigmio ! The morning’s very fine⁠—uncommonly ! See, past the skirts of yon white cloud they go, Tinging it with soft crimsons ! Now below The sable-pointed heads’of firs and pines They dip, move on, and with them moves a glow Along the forest side ! Now amber lines Reach the hill top, and now throughout the valley</p>
			<p>shines.’</p>
			<p>‘ Why, Hum, you ‘re getting quite poetical! Those nows you managed in a special style.’ ‘ If ever you have leisure. Sire, you shall See scraps of mine will make it worth your while, Tit-bits for Phoebus!⁠—yes, you well may smile. Hark ! hark ! the bells !’ ‘A little further yet, Good Hum, and let me view this mighty coil.’</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-402"/>
			<p>Then the great Emperor full graceful set His elbow for a prop, and snuff’d his mignonette.</p>
			<p>LXIV</p>
			<p>The morn is full of holiday : loud bells With rival clamors ring from every spire; Cunningly-station’d music dies and swells In echoing places ; when the winds respire, Light flags stream out like gauzy tongues of fire ; A metropolitan murmur, lifeful, warm. Comes from the northern suburbs; rich attire Freckles with red and gold the moving swarm ; While here and there clear trumpets blow a keen alarm.</p>
			<p>LXV</p>
			<p>And now the fairy escort was seen clear, Like the old pageant of Aurora’s train, Above a pearl-built minster, hovering near ; First wily Crafticant, the chamberlain. Balanced upon his gray-grown pinions twain, His slender wand officially reveal’d ; Then black gnomes scattering sixpences like rain ; Then pages three and three ; and next, slave-held The Imaian ‘scutcheon bright⁠—one mouse in argent field.</p>
			<p>LXVI</p>
			<p>Gentlemen pensioners next; and after them, A troop of winged Janizaries flew ; Then slaves, as presents bearing many a gem ; Then twelve physicians fluttering two and two ; And next a chaplain in a cassock new ; Then Lords in waiting ; then (what head not reels For pleasure ?)⁠—the fair Princess in full view, Borne upon wings⁠—and very pleased she feels To have such splendour dance attendance at her heels.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-403"/>
			<p>LXVII</p>
			<p>For there was more magnificence behind : She waved her handkerchief. ‘ Ah, very grand !’ Cried Elfinan, and closed the window-blind; ‘ And, Hum, we must not shilly-shally stand⁠—Adieu ! adieu ! I ‘m off for Angle-land ! I say, old Hocus, have you such a thing About you⁠—feel your pockets, I command⁠—I want, this instant, an invisible ring⁠—Thank you, old mummy !⁠—now securely I take wing.’</p>
			<p>LXVIII</p>
			<p>Then Elfinan swift vaulted from the floor, And lighted graceful on the window-sill; Under one arm the magic book he bore, The other he could wave about at will; Pale was his face, he stiil look’d very ill: He bow’d at Bellanaine, and said⁠—‘ Poor Bell! Farewell! farewell! and if for ever ! still For ever fare thee well !’⁠—and then he fell A laughing !⁠—snapp’d his fingers !⁠—shame it is to tell!</p>
			<p>LXIX</p>
			<p>‘ By ‘r Lady ! he is gone!’ cries Hum, ‘ and I⁠—(I own it)⁠—have made too free with his wine ; Old Crafticant will smoke me. By-the-bye 1 This room is full of jewels as a mine⁠—Dear valuable creatures, how ye shine ! Sometime to-day I must contrive a minute, If Mercury propitiously incline. To examine his scrutoire, and see what’s in it. For of superfluous diamonds I as well may thin it.</p>
			<p>‘ The Emperor’s horrid bad ; yes, that’s my cue!’ Some histories say that this was Hum’s last speech;</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-404"/>
			<p>That, being fuddled, he went reeling through The corridor, and scarce upright could reach The stair-head ; that being glutted as a leech, And used, as we ourselves have just now said, To manage stairs reversely, like a peach Too ripe, he fell, being puzzled in his head With liquor and the staircase : verdict⁠—found stone dead.</p>
			<p>This, as a falsehood, Crafticanto treats ; And as his style is of strange elegance, Gentle and tender, full of soft conceits, (Much like our Boswell’s,) we will take a glance At his sweet prose, and, if we can, make dance His woven periods into careless rhyme; O, little faery Pegasus ! rear⁠—prance⁠—Trot round the quarto⁠—ordinary time ! March, little Pegasus, with pawing hoof sublime !</p>
			<p>LXXII</p>
			<p>‘ Well, let us see⁠—tentti hook and chapter nine, ‘⁠—Thus Crafticant pursues his diary :⁠—‘ ‘T was twelve o’clock at night, the weather fine. Latitude thirty-six ; our scouts descry A flight of starlings making rapidly Towards Thibet. Mem.:⁠—birds fly in the night; From twelve to half-past⁠—wings not fit to fly For a thick fog⁠—the Princess sulky quite : Caird for an extra shawl, and gave her nurse a bite.</p>
			<p>‘ Five minutes before one⁠—brought down a moth With my new double-barrel⁠—stew’d the thighs. And made a very tolerable broth⁠—Princess turn’d dainty, to our great surprise, Alter’d her mind, and thought it very nice : Seeing her pleasant, tried her with a pun,</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-405"/>
			<p>She frown’d ; a monstrous owl across us flies About this time⁠—a sad old figure of fun; Bad omen⁠—this new match can’t be a happy one.</p>
			<p>* From two to half-past, dusky way we made, Above the plains of Gobi⁠—desert, bleak; Beheld afar off, in the hooded shade Of darkness, a great mountain (strange to speak), Spitting, from forth its sulphur-baken peak, A fan-shaped burst of blood-red, arrowy fire, Turban’d with smoke, which still away did reek. Solid and black from that eternal pyre. Upon the laden winds that scantly could respire,</p>
			<p>LXXV</p>
			<p>‘Just upon three o’clock, a falling star</p>
			<p>Created an alarm among our troop,</p>
			<p>Kill’d a man-cook, a page, and broke a jar,</p>
			<p>A tureen, and three dishes, at one swoop.</p>
			<p>Then passing by the Princess, singed her hoop :</p>
			<p>Could not conceive what Coralline was at.</p>
			<p>She clapp’d her hands three times, and cried out</p>
			<p>“Whoop !” Some strange Imaian custom. A large bat Came sudden ‘fore my face, and brush’d against my hat.</p>
			<p>* Five minutes thirteen seconds after three, Far in the west a mighty fire broke out, Conjectured, on the instant, it might be The city of Balk⁠—’twas Balk beyond all doubt : A griffin, wheeling here and there about. Kept reconnoitering us⁠—doubled our guard⁠—Lighted our torches, and kept up a shout, Till he sheer’d off⁠—the Princess very scared⁠—And many on their marrow-bones for death prepared.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-406"/>
			<p>LXXVII</p>
			<p>‘ At half-past three arose the cheerful moon⁠—Bivoiiack’d for four minutes on a cloud⁠—Where from the earth we heard a lively tune Of tambourines and pipes, severe and loud, While on a flowery lawn a brilliant crowd Cinque-parted danced, some half asleep reposed Beneath the green-faned cedars, some did shroud In silken tents, and ‘mid light fragrance dozed, Or on the open turf their soothed eyelids closed.</p>
			<p>‘Dropp’d my gold watch, and kill’d a kettledrum⁠—It went for apoplexy⁠—foolish folks !⁠—Left it to pay the piper⁠—a good sum⁠—(I ‘ve got a conscience, maugre people’s jokes,) To scrape a little favour ; ‘gan to coax Her Highness’ pug-dog⁠—got a sharp rebuff⁠—She wish’d a game at whist⁠—made three revokes⁠—Turn’d from myself, her partner, in a huff ; His Majesty will know her temper time enough.</p>
			<p>* She cried for chess⁠—I play’d a game with her Castled her king with such a vixen look, It bodes ill to his Majesty⁠—(refer To the second chapter of my fortieth book, And see what hoity-toity airs she took). At half-past four the morn essay’d to beam⁠—Saluted, as we pass’d, an early rook⁠—The Princess fell asleep, and, in her dream, Talk’d of one Master Hubert, deep in her esteem.</p>
			<p>‘ About this time⁠—making delightful way⁠—Shed a quill-feather from my larboard wing⁠—</p>

			<p>Wish’d, trusted, hoped ‘t was no sign of decay⁠—Thank Heaven, I ‘m hearty yet!⁠—‘t was no such</p>
			<p>thing:⁠—At five the golden light began to spring, With fiery shudder through the bloomed east; At six we heard Panthea’s churches ring⁠—The city all his unhived swarms had cast, To watch our grand approach, and hail us as we</p>
			<p>pass’d.</p>
			<p>* As flowers turn their faces to the sam, So on our flight with hungry eyes they gaze. And, as we shaped our course, this, that way run, With mad-cap pleasure, or hand-clasp’d amaze : Sweet in the air a mild-toned music plays, And progresses through its own labyrinth ; Buds gather’d from the green spring’s middle-days, They scatter’d⁠—daisy, primrose, hyacinth⁠—Or round white columns wreathed from capital to plinth.</p>
			<p>‘ Onward we floated o’er the panting streets, That seem’d throughout with upheld faces paved ; Look where we will, our bird’s-eye vision meets Legions of holiday ; bright standards waved, And fluttering ensigns emulously craved Our minute’s glance ; a busy thunderous roar,</p>
			<p>I From square to square, among the buildings raved. As when the sea, at flow, gluts up once more</p>
			<p>The craggy hoUowness of a wild-reefed shore.</p>
			<p>* And ” Bellanaine for ever ! ” shouted they ! While that fair Princess, from her winged chair,</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-408"/>
			<p>Bow’d low with high demeanour, and, to pay Their new-blown loyalty with guerdon fair. Still emptied, at meet distance, here and there, A plenty horn of jewels. And here I (Who wish to give the devil her due) declare Against that ugly piece of calumny. Which calls them Highland pebble-stones not worth a fly.</p>
			<p>LXXXIV</p>
			<p>* Still “Bellanaine ! “they shouted, while we glide ‘Slant to a light Ionic portico,</p>
			<p>The city’s delicacy, and the pride Of our Imperial Basilic ; a row ,</p>
			<p>Of lords and ladies, on each hand, make show Submissive of knee-bent obeisance, All down the steps ; and, as we enter’d, lo! The strangest sight⁠—the most unlook’d-for chance⁠—All things turn’d topsy-turvy in a devil’s dance.</p>
			<p>LXXXV</p>
			<p>“Stead of his anxious Majesty and court At the open doors, with wide saluting eyes. Congees and scrape-graces of every sort, And all the smooth routine of gallantries. Was seen, to our immoderate surprise, A motley crowd thick gather’d in the hall, Lords, scullions, deputy-scullions, with wild cries Stunning the vestible from wall to wall. Where the Chief Justice on his knees and hands doth crawl.</p>
			<p>LXXXVI</p>
			<p>* Counts of the palace, and the state purveyor Of moth’s-down, to make soft the royal beds, The Common Council and my fool Lord Mayor Marching a-row, each other slipshod treads;</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-409"/>
			<p>Powder’d bag-wigs and ruffy-tuffy heads Of cinder wenches meet and soil each other ; Toe crush’d with heel ill-natured fighting breeds, Frill-rumpling elbows brew up many a bother, And fists in the short ribs keep up the yell and pother.</p>
			<p>‘ A Poet, mounted on the Court-Clown’s back, Rode to the Princess swift with spurring heels, And close into her face, with rhyming clack, Began a Prothalamion ;⁠—she reels, She falls, she faints ! ■⁠—while laughter peals Over her woman’s weakness. ” Where ! ” cried I, ” Where is his Majesty ? ” No person feels Inclined to answer; wherefore instantly I plunged into the crowd to find him or to die.</p>
			<p>‘ Jostling my way I gain’d the stairs, and ran To the first landing, where, incredible ! I met, far gone in liquor, that old man,</p>
			<p>That vile impostor Hum, ‘</p>
			<p>So far so well⁠—For we have proved the Mago never fell Down stairs on Crafticanto’s evidence ; And therefore duly shall proceed to tell,’ Plain in our own original mood and tense. The sequel of this day, though labour’t is immense!</p>

			<p>THE LAST SONNET</p>
			<p>Bright star, would I were steadfast as thou art !</p>
			<p>Not in lone splendour liung aloft the night, And watching, with eternal lids apart,</p>
			<p>Like Nature’s patient sleepless Eremite, The moving waters at their priestlike task</p>
			<p>Of pure ablution round earth’s human shores Or gazing on the new soft fallen mask</p>
			<p>Of snow upon the mountains and the moors: No⁠—yet still steadfast, still unchangeable,</p>
			<p>Pillow’d upon my fair love’s ripening breast, To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,</p>
			<p>Awake for ever in a sweet unrest. Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath. And so live ever⁠—or else swoon to death.</p>

			<p>SUPPLEMENTARY VERSE</p>
			<p>The collection which follows is not intended to be taken exactly as containing the leavings of Keats’s genius ; there are verses in the previous groups which might be placed here, if the intention was to make a marked division between his well-defined poetry and his experiments and mere scintillations ; doubtless, too, on any such principle it would be just to take back into the respectability of larger type some of the lines here included. But it seemed wise to put into a subordinate group the poet’s fragmentary and posthumous poems, and those which were plainly the mere playthings of his muse.</p>
			<p>I. HYPERION: A VISION</p>
			<p>[*An attempt at remodelling the fragment of Hyperion into the form of a vision.’]</p>
			<p>CANTO I</p>
			<p>Fanatics have their dreams, wherewith they weave</p>
			<p>A paradise for a sect; the savage, too,</p>
			<p>From forth the loftiest fashion of his sleep</p>
			<p>Guesses at heaven ; pity these have not</p>
			<p>Trao’dupon vellum or wild Indian leaf</p>
			<p>The shadows of melodious utterance.</p>
			<p>But bare of laurel they live, dream, and die ;</p>
			<p>For Poesy alone can tell her dreams⁠—</p>
			<p>With the fine spell of words alone can save</p>
			<p>Imagination from the sable chain lo</p>
			<p>And dumb enchantment. “Who alive can say,</p>
			<p>* Thou art no Poet⁠—may’st not tell thy dreams’ ?</p>
			<p>Since every man whose soul is not a clod</p>
			<p>Hath visions and would speak, if he had loved,</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-412"/>
			<p>And been well nurtured in his mother tongue. Whether the dream now purpos’d to rehearse Be poet’s or fanatic’s will be known When this warm scribe, my hand, is in the grave.</p>
			<p>Methought I stood where trees of every clime,</p>
			<p>Palm, myrtle, oak, and sycamore, and beech, 2c</p>
			<p>With plantane and spice-blossoms, made a screen.</p>
			<p>In neighbourhood of fountains (by the noise</p>
			<p>Soft-showering in mine ears), and (by the touch</p>
			<p>Of scent) not far from roses. Twining round</p>
			<p>I saw an arbour with a drooping roof</p>
			<p>Of trellis vines, and bells, and larger blooms,</p>
			<p>Like floral censers, swinging light in air ;</p>
			<p>Before its wreathed doorway, on a mound</p>
			<p>Of moss, was spread a feast of summer fruits,</p>
			<p>Which, nearer seen, seem’d refuse of a meal_ 30</p>
			<p>By angel tasted or our Mother Eve ;</p>
			<p>For empty shells were scatter’d on the grass,</p>
			<p>And grapestalks but half-bare, and remnants more</p>
			<p>Sweet-smelling, whose pure kinds I could not know.</p>
			<p>Still was more plenty than the fabled horn</p>
			<p>Thrice emptied could pour forth at banqueting,</p>
			<p>For Proserpine return’d to her own fields,</p>
			<p>Where the white heifers low. And appetite,</p>
			<p>More yearning than on earth I ever felt,</p>
			<p>Growing within, I ate deliciously⁠—4°</p>
			<p>And, after not long, thirsted ; for thereby</p>
			<p>Stood a cool vessel of transparent juice</p>
			<p>Sipp’d by the wander’d bee, the which I took,</p>
			<p>And pledging all the mortals of the world.</p>
			<p>And all the dead whose names are in our lips.</p>
			<p>Drank. That full draught is parent of my theme.</p>
			<p>No Asian poppy nor elixir fine</p>
			<p>Of the soon fading, jealous Caliphat,</p>
			<p>No poison gender’d in close monkish cell.</p>
			<p>To thin the scarlet conclave of old men, 50</p>
			<p>Could so have rapt unwilling life away.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-413"/>
			<p>Among the fragrant husks and berries crush’d</p>
			<p>Upon the grass, I struggled hard against</p>
			<p>The domineering potion, but in vain.</p>
			<p>The cloudy swoon came on, and down I sank,</p>
			<p>Like a Silenus on an antique vase.</p>
			<p>How long I slumber’d ‘t is a chance to guess.</p>
			<p>When sense of life return’d, I started up</p>
			<p>As if with wings, but the fair trees were gone,</p>
			<p>The mossy mound and arbour were no more : 60</p>
			<p>I look’d around upon the curved sides</p>
			<p>Of an old sanctuary, with roof august,</p>
			<p>Builded so high, it seem’d that filmed clouds</p>
			<p>Might spread beneath as o’er the stars of heaven.</p>
			<p>So old the place was, I remember’d none</p>
			<p>The like upon the earth : what I had seen</p>
			<p>Of grey cathedrals, buttress’d walls, rent towers.</p>
			<p>The superannuations of sunk realms.</p>
			<p>Or Nature’s rocks toil’d hard in waves and winds,</p>
			<p>Seem’d but the faulture of decrepit things 70</p>
			<p>To that eternal domed monument.</p>
			<p>Upon the marble at my feet there lay</p>
			<p>Store of strange vessels and large draperies,</p>
			<p>Which needs had been of dyed asbestos wove,</p>
			<p>Or in that place the moth could not corrupt,,</p>
			<p>So white the linen, so, in some, distinct</p>
			<p>Ran imageries from a sombre loom.</p>
			<p>All in a mingled heap confus’d there lay</p>
			<p>Robes, golden tongs, censer and chafing-dish,</p>
			<p>Girdles, and chains, and holy jewelries. 80</p>
			<p>Turning from these with awe, once more I raised My eyes to fathom the space every way : The embossed roof, the silent massy range Of columns north and south, ending in mist Of nothing ; then to eastward, where black gates Were shut against the sunrise evermore; Then to the west I look’d, and saw far off An image, huge of feature as a cloud.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-414"/>
			<p>At level of whose feet an altar slept,</p>
			<p>To be approach’d on either side by steps 90</p>
			<p>And marble balustrade, and patient travail</p>
			<p>To count with toil the innumerable degrees.</p>
			<p>Toward the altar sober-pac’d I went,</p>
			<p>Repressing haste as too unholy there ;</p>
			<p>And, coming nearer, saw beside the shrine</p>
			<p>One ministering ; and there arose a flame</p>
			<p>When in mid-day the sickening east-wind</p>
			<p>Shifts sudden to the south, the small warm rain</p>
			<p>Melts out the frozen incense from all flowers.</p>
			<p>And fills the air with so much pleasant health 100</p>
			<p>That even the dying man forgets his shroud ;⁠—</p>
			<p>Even so that lofty sacrificial fire,</p>
			<p>Sending forth Maian incense, spread around</p>
			<p>Forgetfulness of everything but bliss,</p>
			<p>And clouded all the altar with soft smoke ;</p>
			<p>From whose white fragrant curtains thus I heard</p>
			<p>Language pronounc’d : ‘ If thou canst not ascend</p>
			<p>These steps, die on that marble where thou art.</p>
			<p>Thy flesh, near cousin to the common dust,</p>
			<p>Will parch for lack of nutriment; thy bones no</p>
			<p>Will wither in few years, and vanish so</p>
			<p>That not the quickest eye could find a grain</p>
			<p>Of what thou now art on that pavement cold.</p>
			<p>The sands of thy short life are spent this hour,</p>
			<p>And no hand in the universe can turn</p>
			<p>Thy hourglass, if these gummed leaves be burnt</p>
			<p>Ere thou canst mount up these immortal steps.’</p>
			<p>I heard, I look’d : two senses both at once,</p>
			<p>So fine, so subtle, felt the tyranny</p>
			<p>Of that fierce threat and the hard task proposed. 120</p>
			<p>Prodigious seem’d the toil; the leaves were yet</p>
			<p>Burning, when suddenly a palsied chill</p>
			<p>Struck from the paved level up my limbs,</p>
			<p>And was ascending quick to put cold grasp</p>
			<p>Upon those streams that pulse beside the throat.</p>
			<p>I shriek’d, and the sharp anguish of my shriek</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-415"/>
			<p>Stung my own ears; I strove hard to escape</p>
			<p>The numbness, strove to gain the lowest step.</p>
			<p>Slow, heavy, deadly was my pace : the cold</p>
			<p>Grew stifling, suffocating at the heart; 130</p>
			<p>And when I clasp’d my hands I felt them not.</p>
			<p>One minute before death my ic’d foot touch’d</p>
			<p>The lowest stair ; and, as it touch’d, life seem’d</p>
			<p>To pour in at the toes, I mounted up</p>
			<p>As once fair angels on a ladder flew</p>
			<p>From the green turf to heaven. ‘ Holy Power,’</p>
			<p>Cried I, approaching near the horned shrine,</p>
			<p>* What am I that should so be saved from death ?</p>
			<p>“What am I that another death come not</p>
			<p>To choke my utterance, sacrilegious, here ?’ 140</p>
			<p>Then said the veiled shadow : ‘ Thou hast felt</p>
			<p>What’t is to die and live again before</p>
			<p>Thy fated hour ; that thou hadst power to do so</p>
			<p>Is thine own safety ; thou hast dated on</p>
			<p>Thy doom.’ ‘ High Prophetess,’ said I, ‘ purge off</p>
			<p>Benign, if so it please thee, my mind’s film.’</p>
			<p>‘ None can usurp this height,’ return’d that shade,</p>
			<p>‘ But those to whom the miseries of the world</p>
			<p>Are misery, and will not let them rest.</p>
			<p>All else who find a haven in the world, 150</p>
			<p>Where they may thoughtless sleep away their days,</p>
			<p>If by a chance into this fane they come,</p>
			<p>Rot on the pavement where thou rottedst half.</p>
			<p>‘ Are there not thousands in the world,’ said I,</p>
			<p>Encourag’d by the sooth voice of the shade,</p>
			<p>‘ Who love their fellows even to the death,</p>
			<p>Who feel the giant agony of the world,</p>
			<p>And more, like slaves to poor humanity,</p>
			<p>Labour for mortal good ? I sure should see</p>
			<p>Other men here, but I am here alone.’ i6o</p>
			<p>‘ Those whom thou spakest of are no visionaries,’</p>
			<p>Rejoin’d that voice ; ‘they are no dreamers weak;</p>
			<p>They seek no wonder but the human face,</p>
			<p>No music but a happy-noted voice :</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-416"/>
			<p>They come not here, they have no thought to come;</p>
			<p>And thou art here, for thou art less than they.</p>
			<p>What benefit canst thou do, or all thy tribe,</p>
			<p>To the great world ? Thou art a dreaming thing,</p>
			<p>A fever of thyself: think of the earth ;</p>
			<p>What bliss, even in hope, is there for thee ? , 170</p>
			<p>What haven ? every creature hath its home,</p>
			<p>Every sole man hath days of joy and pain,</p>
			<p>Whether his labours be sublime or low⁠—</p>
			<p>The pain alone, the joy alone, distinct:</p>
			<p>Only the dreamer venoms all his days.</p>
			<p>Bearing more woe than all his sins deserve.</p>
			<p>Tkerefore, that happiness be somewhat shared,</p>
			<p>Such things as thou art are admitted oft</p>
			<p>Into like gardens thou didst pass erewhile.</p>
			<p>And suffer’d in these temples: for that cause 180</p>
			<p>Thou standestsafe beneath this statue’s knees.’</p>
			<p>‘ That I am favour’d for unworthiness. By such propitious parley medicined In sickness not ignoble, I rejoice. Aye, and could weep for love of such award.’ So answer’d I, continuing, ‘ If it please. Majestic shadow, tell me where I am. Whose altar this, for whom this incense curls ; What image this whose face I cannot see For the broad marble knees; and who thou art, 190 Of accent feminine so courteous ?’</p>
			<p>Then the tall shade, in drooping linen veil’d. Spoke out, so much more earnest, that her breath Stirr’d the thin folds of gauze that drooping hung About a golden censer from her hand Pendent; and by her voice I knew she shed Long-treasured tears. ‘ This temple, sad and lone. Is all spar’d from the thunder of a war Foughten long since by giant hierarchy Against rebellion : this old image here, 200</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-417"/>
			<p>“Whose carved features wrinkled as he fell,</p>
			<p>Is Saturn’s ; I, Moneta, left supreme,</p>
			<p>Sole goddess of this desolation.’</p>
			<p>I had no words to answer, for my tongue,</p>
			<p>Useless, could find about its roofed home</p>
			<p>No syllable of a fit majesty</p>
			<p>To make rejoinder to Moneta’s mourn :</p>
			<p>There was a silence, while the altar’s blaze</p>
			<p>Was fainting for sweet food. I look’d thereon,</p>
			<p>And on the paved floor, where nigh were piled 210</p>
			<p>Faggots of cinnamon, and many heaps</p>
			<p>Of other crisped spicewood : then again</p>
			<p>I look’d upon the altar, and its horns</p>
			<p>Whiten’d with ashes, and its languorous flame,</p>
			<p>And then upon the offerings again ;</p>
			<p>And so, by turns, till sad Moneta cried :</p>
			<p>* The sacrifice is done, but not the less</p>
			<p>Will I be kind to thee for thy good will.</p>
			<p>My power, which to me is still a curse,</p>
			<p>Shall be to thee a wonder ; for the scenes 220</p>
			<p>Still swooning vivid through my globed brain,</p>
			<p>With an electral changing misery.</p>
			<p>Thou shalt with these dull mortal eyes behold</p>
			<p>Free from all pain, if wonder pain thee not.’</p>
			<p>As near as an immortal’s sphered words</p>
			<p>Could to a mother’s soften were these last:</p>
			<p>And yet I had a terror of her robes.</p>
			<p>And chiefly of the veils that from her brow</p>
			<p>Hung pale, and curtain’d her in mysteries.</p>
			<p>That made my heart too small to hold its blood. 230</p>
			<p>This saw that Goddess, and with sacred hand</p>
			<p>Parted the veils. Then saw I a wan face,</p>
			<p>Not pin’d by human sorrows, but bright-blanch’d</p>
			<p>By an immortal sickness which kills not;</p>
			<p>It works a constant change, which happy death</p>
			<p>Can put no end to ; death wards progressing</p>
			<p>To no death was that visage ; it had past</p>
			<p>The lily and the snow ; and beyond these</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-418"/>
			<p>I must not think now, though I saw that face.</p>
			<p>But for her eyes I should have fled away; 240</p>
			<p>They held me back with a benignant light,</p>
			<p>Soft, mitigated by divinest lids</p>
			<p>Half-clos’d, and visionless entire they seem’d</p>
			<p>Of all external things ; they saw me not,</p>
			<p>But in blank splendour beam’d, like the mild moon,</p>
			<p>Who comforts those she sees not, who knows not</p>
			<p>What eyes are upward cast. As I had found</p>
			<p>A grain of gold upon a mountain’s side,</p>
			<p>And, twing’d with avarice, strain’d out my eyes</p>
			<p>To search its sullen entrails rich with ore, 250</p>
			<p>So, at the view of sad Moneta’s brow,</p>
			<p>I ask’d to see what things the hollow brow</p>
			<p>Behind environ’d : what high tragedy</p>
			<p>In the dark secret chambers of her skull</p>
			<p>Was acting, that could give so dread a stress</p>
			<p>To her cold lips, and fill with such a light</p>
			<p>Her planetary eyes, and touch her voice</p>
			<p>With such a sorrow ? ‘ Shade of Memory J’</p>
			<p>Cried I, with act adorant at her feet,</p>
			<p>‘ By all the gloom hung round thy fallen house, 26c-</p>
			<p>By this last temple, by the golden age.</p>
			<p>By great Apollo, thy dear foster-child.</p>
			<p>And by thyself, forlorn divinity,</p>
			<p>The pale Omega of a wither’d race.</p>
			<p>Let me behold, according as thou saidst,</p>
			<p>What in thy brain so ferments to and fro !’</p>
			<p>No sooner had this conjuration past</p>
			<p>My devout lips, than side by side we stood</p>
			<p>(Like a stunt bramble by a solemn pine)</p>
			<p>Deep in the shady sadness of a vale 270</p>
			<p>Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn,</p>
			<p>Far from the fiery noon and eve’s one star.</p>
			<p>Onward I look’d beneath the gloomy boughs,</p>
			<p>And saw what first I thought an image huge.</p>
			<p>Like to the image pedestall’d so high</p>
			<p>In Saturn’s temple; then Moneta’s voice</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-419"/>
			<p>Came brief upon mine ear. ‘ So Saturn sat</p>
			<p>When he had lost his reahns ;’ whereon there grew</p>
			<p>A power within me of enormous ken</p>
			<p>To see as a god sees, and take the depth 280</p>
			<p>Of things as nimbly as the outward eye</p>
			<p>Can size and shape pervade. The lofty theme</p>
			<p>Of those few words hung vast before my mind</p>
			<p>With half-unraveird web. I sat myself</p>
			<p>Upon an eagle’s watch, that I might see,</p>
			<p>And seeing ne’er forget. No stir of life</p>
			<p>Was in this shrouded vale⁠—not so much air</p>
			<p>As in the zoning of a summer’s day</p>
			<p>Robs not one light seed from the feather’d grass</p>
			<p>But where the dead leaf fell there did it rest. 290</p>
			<p>A stream went noiseless by, still deaden’d more</p>
			<p>By reason of the fallen divinity</p>
			<p>Spreading more shade; the Naiad ‘mid her reeds</p>
			<p>Prest her cold finger closer to her lips.</p>
			<p>Along the margin-sand large foot-marks went No further than to where old Saturn’s feet Had rested, and there slept how long a sleep ! Degraded, cold, upon the sodden ground His old right hand lay nerveless, listless, dead, Unsceptred, and his realmless eyes were closed ; 300 While his bowed head seem’d listening to the Earth, His ancient mother, for some comfort yet.</p>
			<p>It seem’d no force could wake him from his place; But there came one who, with a kindred hand, Touch’d his wide shoulders, after bending low With reverence, though to one who knew it not. Then came the grieved voice Mnemosyne, And griev’d I hearken’d. ‘ That divinity Whom thou saw’st step from yon forlornest wood, And with slow pace approach our fallen king, 310 Is Thea, softest-natured of our brood.’ I mark’d the Goddess, in fair statuary</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-420"/>
			<p>Surpassing wan Moneta by the head,</p>
			<p>And in her sorrow nearer woman’s tears.</p>
			<p>There was a list’ning fear in her regard,</p>
			<p>As if calamity had but begun ;</p>
			<p>As if the venom’d cloud of evil days</p>
			<p>Had spent their malice, and the sullen rear</p>
			<p>Was with its stored thunder labouring up.</p>
			<p>One hand she press’d upon that aching spot 320</p>
			<p>Where beats the human heart, as if just there,</p>
			<p>Though an immortal, she felt cruel pain ;</p>
			<p>The other upon Saturn’s bended neck</p>
			<p>She laid, and to the level of his ear</p>
			<p>Leaning, with parted lips some words she spoke</p>
			<p>In solemn tenour and deep organ-tone ;</p>
			<p>Some mourning words, which in our feeble tongue</p>
			<p>Would come in this like accenting ; how frail</p>
			<p>To that large utterance of the early gods !</p>
			<p>* Saturn, look up ! and for what, poor lost king ? I have no comfort for thee ; no, not one ; 331</p>
			<p>I cannot say, wherefore thus sleepest thou ? For Heaven is parted from thee, and the Earth Knows thee not, so aMcted, for a god. •</p>
			<p>The Ocean, too, with all its solemn noise. Has from thy sceptre pass’d ; and all the air Is emptied of thy hoary majesty. f</p>
			<p>Thy thunder, captious at the new command, Rumbles reluctant o’er our fallen house ; And thy sharp lightning, in unpractis’d hands, 340 Scourges and burns our once serene domain.</p>
			<p>‘With such remorseless speed still come new woes, That unbelief has not a space to breathe. Saturn ! sleep on : me thoughtless, why should I Thus violate thy slumbrous solitude ? Why should I ope thy melancholy eyes ? • Saturn ! sleep on, while at thy feet I weep.’</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-421"/>
			<p>As when upon a tranced summer-night Forests, branch-charmed by the earnest stars, Dream, and so dream all night without a noise, 350 Save from one gradual solitary gust Swelling upon the silence, dying off, As if the ebbing air had but one wave, So came these words and went; the while in tears She prest her fair large forehead to the earth, Just where her fallen hair might spread in curls, A soft and silken net for Saturn’s feet. Long, long these two were postured motionless. Like sculpture builded-up upon the grave Of their own power. A long awful time 360</p>
			<p>I look’d upon them: still they were the same ; The frozen God still bending to the earth, And the sad Goddess weeping at his feet; Moneta silent. Without stay or prop But my own weak mortality, I bore The load of this eternal quietude. The unchanging gloom and the three fixed shapes Ponderous upon my senses, a whole moon ; For by my burning brain I measiu-ed sure Her silver seasons shedded on the night, 370</p>
			<p>And every day by day methought I grew More gaunt and ghostly. Oftentimes I pray’d Intense, that death would take me from the vale And all its burthens ; gasping with despair Of change, hour after hour I curs’d myself, Until old Saturn rais’d his faded eyes. And look’d around and saw his kingdom gone, And all the gloom and sorrow of the place, And that fair kneeling Goddess at his feet.</p>
			<p>As the moist scent of flowers, and grass, and leaves 380</p>
			<p>Fills forest-dells with a pervading air. Known to the woodland nostril, so the words Of Saturn fill’d the mossy glooms around,</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-422"/>
			<p>Even to the hollows of time-eaten oaks, And to the windings of the foxes’ hole, With sad, low tones, while thus he spoke, and sent Strange moanings to the solitary Pan. * Moan, brethren, moan, for we are swallow’d up And buried from all godlike exercise Of influence benign on planets pale, 390</p>
			<p>And peaceful sway upon man’s harvesting, And all those acts which Deity supreme Doth ease its heart of love in. Moan and wail; Moan, brethren, moan; for lo, the rebel spheres Spin round ; the stars their ancient courses keep ; Clouds still with shadowy moisture haunt the earth, Still suck their fill of light from sun and moon ; Still buds the tree, and still the seashores murmur; There is no death in all the universe, No smell of death. — There shall be death. Moan, moan; 400</p>
			<p>Moan, Cybele, moan ; for thy pernicious babes Have chang’d a god into an aching palsy. Moan, brethren, moan, for I have no strength left; Weak as the reed, weak, feeble as my voice. Oh! Oh! the pain, the pain of feebleness; Moan, moan, for still I thaw ; or give me help, Throw down those imps, and give me victory. Let me hear other groans, and trumpets blown Of triumph calm, and hymns of festival. From the gold peaks of heaven’s high-piled clouds; Voices of soft proclaim, and silver stir 411</p>
			<p>Of strings in hollow shells ; and there shall be Beautiful things made new, for the surprise Of the sky-children.’ So he feebly ceased. With such a poor and sickly-sounding pause, Methought I heard some old man of the earth Bewailing earthly loss; nor could my eyes And ears act with that unison of sense Which marries sweet sound with the grace of form, And dolorous accent from a tragic harp 420</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-423"/>
			<p>With large limb’d visions. More I scrutinized.</p>
			<p>Still fixt he sat beneath the sable trees,</p>
			<p>“Whose arms spread straggling in wild serpent forms,</p>
			<p>With leaves all hush’d ; his awful presence there</p>
			<p>(Now all was silent) gave a deadly lie</p>
			<p>To what I ere while heard : only his lips</p>
			<p>Trembled amid the white curls of his beard;</p>
			<p>They told the truth, though round the snowy locks</p>
			<p>Hung nobly, as upon the face of heaven</p>
			<p>A mid-day fleece of clouds. Thea arose 430</p>
			<p>And stretcht her white arm through the hollow dark.</p>
			<p>Pointing somewhither : whereat he too rose,</p>
			<p>Like a vast giant, seen by men at sea</p>
			<p>To grow pale from the waves at dull midnight.</p>
			<p>They melted from my sight into the woods;</p>
			<p>Ere I could turn, Moneta cried, ‘ These twain</p>
			<p>Are speeding to the families of grief.</p>
			<p>Where, rooft in by black rocks, they waste in pain</p>
			<p>And darkness, for no hope.’ And she spake on.</p>
			<p>As ye may read who can unwearied pass 440</p>
			<p>Onward from the antechamber of this dream,</p>
			<p>Where, even at the open doors, awhile</p>
			<p>I must delay, and glean my memory</p>
			<p>Of her high phrase⁠—perhaps no further dare.</p>
			<p>CANTO II</p>
			<p>* Mortal, that thou may’st understand aright, I humanize my sayings to thine ear, Making comparisons of earthly things ; Or thou might’st better listen to the wind. Whose language is to thee a barren noise, Though it blows legend-laden thro’ the trees. In melancholy realms big tears are shed, More sorrow like to this, and such like woe, Too huge for mortal tongue or pen of scribe. The Titans fierce, self-hid or prison-bound, 10</p>
			<p>Groan for the old allegiance once more,</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-424"/>
			<p>Listening in their doom for Saturn’s voice.</p>
			<p>But one of the whole eagle-brood still keeps</p>
			<p>His sovereignty, and rule, and majesty :</p>
			<p>Blazing Hyperion on his orbed fire</p>
			<p>Still sits, still snuffs the incense teeming up</p>
			<p>From Man to the Sun’s God⁠—yet insecure.</p>
			<p>For as upon the earth dire prodigies</p>
			<p>Fright and perplex, so also shudders he ;</p>
			<p>Not at dog’s howl or gloom-bird’s hated screech, 20</p>
			<p>Or the familiar visiting of one</p>
			<p>Upon the first toll of his passing bell,</p>
			<p>Or prophesyings of the midnight lamp;</p>
			<p>But horrors, portioned to a giant nerve.</p>
			<p>Make great Hyperion ache. His palace bright,</p>
			<p>Bastion’d with pyramids of shining gold.</p>
			<p>And touch’d with shade of bronzed obelisks,</p>
			<p>Glares a blood-red thro’ all the thousand courts,</p>
			<p>Arches, and domes, and fiery galleries ;</p>
			<p>And all its curtains of Aurorian clouds 30</p>
			<p>Flash angerly ; when he would taste the wreaths</p>
			<p>Of incense breath’d aloft from sacred hills.</p>
			<p>Instead of sweets, his ample palate takes</p>
			<p>Savour of poisonous brass and metals sick;</p>
			<p>Wherefore when harbour’d in the sleepy “West,</p>
			<p>After the full completion of fair day.</p>
			<p>For rest divine upon exalted couch.</p>
			<p>And slumber in the arms of melody,</p>
			<p>He paces through the pleasant hours of ease,</p>
			<p>With strides colossal, on from hall to hall, 40</p>
			<p>While far within each aisle and deep recess</p>
			<p>His winged minions in close clusters stand</p>
			<p>Amaz’d, and full of fear ; like anxious men,</p>
			<p>Who on a wide plain gather in sad troops.</p>
			<p>When earthquakes jar their battlements and towers.</p>
			<p>Even now where Saturn, rous’d from icy trance,</p>
			<p>Goes step for step with Thea from yon woods,</p>
			<p>Hyperion, leaving twilight in the rear.</p>
			<p>Is sloping to the threshold of the West.</p>

			<p>Thither we tend.’ Now in clear light I stood, 50</p>
			<p>Reliev’d from the dusk vale. Mnemosyne</p>
			<p>Was sitting on a sqiiare-edg’d polish’d stone,</p>
			<p>That in its lucid depths reflected pure</p>
			<p>Her priestess’ garments. My quick eyes ran on</p>
			<p>From stately nave to nave, from vault to vault,</p>
			<p>Through bow’rs of fragrant and enwreathed light,</p>
			<p>And diamond-paved lustrous long arcades.</p>
			<p>Anon rush’d by the bright Hyperion ;</p>
			<p>His flaming robes stream’d out beyond his heels,</p>
			<p>And gave a roar as if of earthly fire, 6c</p>
			<p>That scar’d away the meek ethereal hours,</p>
			<p>And made their dove-wings tremble. On he flared.</p>

			<p>And what is love ? It is a doll dress’d up For idleness to cosset, nurse, and dandle ;</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-426"/>
			<p>A thing of soft misnomers, so divine</p>
			<p>That silly youth doth think to make itself</p>

			<p>Ill</p>
			<p>FRAGMENT OF ‘THE CASTLE BUILDER’</p>
			<p>To-night I’ 11 have my friar⁠—let me think</p>
			<p>About my room⁠—I ’11 have it in the pink ;</p>
			<p>It should be rich and sombre, and the moon,</p>
			<p>Just in its mid-life in the midst of June</p>
			<p>Should look thro’ four large windows and display</p>
			<p>Clear, but for gold-fish vases in the way.</p>
			<p>Their glassy diamonding on Turkish floor ;</p>
			<p>The tapers keep aside, an hour and more,</p>
			<p>To see what else the moon alone can show ;</p>
			<p>While the night-breeze doth softly let us know</p>
			<p>My terrace is well bower’d with oranges.</p>
			<p>Upon the floor the dullest spirit sees</p>
			<p>A guitar-ribband and a lady’s glove</p>
			<p>Beside a crumple-leaved tale of love ;</p>
			<p>A tambour-frame, with Venus sleeping there,</p>
			<p>All finish’d but some ringlets of her hair ;</p>
			<p>A viol, bow-strings torn, cross-wise upon</p>
			<p>A glorious folio of Anacreon;</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-427"/>
			<p>A skull upon a mat of roses lying,</p>
			<p>Ink’d purple with a song concerning dying;</p>
			<p>An hour-glass on the turn, amid the trails</p>
			<p>Of passion-flower;⁠—just in time there sails</p>
			<p>A cloud across the moon⁠—the lights bring in I</p>
			<p>And see what more my phantasy can win.</p>
			<p>It is a gorgeous room, but somewhat sad ;</p>
			<p>The draperies are so, as tho’ they had</p>
			<p>Been made for Cleopatra’s winding-sheet;</p>
			<p>And opposite the stedfast eye doth meet</p>
			<p>A spacious looking-glass, upon whose face,</p>
			<p>In letters raven-sombre, you may trace</p>
			<p>Old ‘Mene, Mene, Tekel Upharsin.’</p>
			<p>Greek busts and statuary have ever been</p>
			<p>Held, by the finest spirits, fitter far.</p>
			<p>Than vase grotesque and Siamesian jar ;</p>
			<p>Therefore ‘t is sure a want of Attic taste</p>
			<p>That I should rather love a Gothic waste</p>
			<p>Of eyesight on cinque-coloured potter’s clay,</p>
			<p>Than on the marble fairness of old Greece.</p>
			<p>My table-co verlits of Jason’s fleece</p>
			<p>And black Numidian sheep-wool should be wrought,</p>
			<p>Gold, black, and heavy, from the Lama brought.</p>
			<p>My ebon sofas should delicious be</p>
			<p>With down from Leda’s cygnet progeny.</p>
			<p>My pictures all Salvator’s, save a few</p>
			<p>Of Titian’s portraiture, and one, though new.</p>
			<p>Of Haydon’s in its fresh magnificence.</p>
			<p>My wine⁠—O good ! ‘t is here at my desire,</p>
			<p>And I must sit to supper with my friar.</p>
			<p>IV EXTRACTS FROM AN OPERA</p>
			<p>O! WERE I one of the Olympian twelve, Their godships should pass this into a law, That when a man doth set himself in toil</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-428"/>
			<p>After some beauty veiled far away,</p>
			<p>Eacli step he took should make his lady’s hand</p>
			<p>More soft, more white, and her fair cheek more fair:</p>
			<p>And for each briar-berry he might eat,</p>
			<p>A kiss should bud upon the tree of love,</p>
			<p>And pulp and ripen richer every hour.</p>
			<p>To melt away upon the traveller’s lips.</p>
			<p>DAISY’S SONG</p>
			<p>The sun, with his great eye, Sees not so much as I; And the moon, all silver-proud, Might as well be in a cloud.</p>
			<p>And O the spring⁠—the spring ! I lead the life of a King ! Couch’d in the teeming grass, I spy each pretty lass.</p>
			<p>I look where no one dares. And I stare where no one stares, And when the night is nigh. Lambs bleat my lullaby.</p>
			<p>FOLLY’S SONG</p>
			<p>When wedding fiddles are a-playing,</p>
			<p>Huzza for folly O I And when maidens go a-Maying,</p>
			<p>Huzza, etc. “When a milk-pail is upset,</p>
			<p>Huzza, etc. And the clothes left in the wet,</p>
			<p>Huzza, etc. When the barrel’s set abroach.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-429"/>
			<p>Huzza, etc. When Kate Eyebrow keeps a coach,</p>
			<p>Huzza, etc. When the pig is over-roasted,</p>
			<p>Huzza, etc. And the cheese is over-toasted.</p>
			<p>Huzza, etc. When Sir Snap is with his lawyer.</p>
			<p>Huzza, etc. And Miss Chip has kiss’d the sawyer ;</p>
			<p>Huzza, etc.</p>
			<p>Oh, I am frighten’d with most hateful thoughts! Perhaps her voice is not a nightingale’s. Perhaps her teeth are not the fairest pearl; Her eye-lashes may be, for aught I know, Not longer than the May-fly’s small fanhorns; There may not be one dimple on her hand ; And freckles many; ah ! a careless nurse, In haste to teach the little thing to walk. May have crumpt up a pair of Dian’s legs, And warpt the ivory of a Juno’s neck.</p>
			<p>SONG</p>
			<p>The stranger lighted from his steed. And ere he spake a word,</p>
			<p>He seiz’d my lady’s lily hand. And kiss’d it all unheard.</p>
			<p>The stranger walk’d into the hall, And ere he spake a word.</p>
			<p>He kiss’d my lady’s cherry lips, And kiss’d ’em all unheard.</p>
			<p>The stranger walk’d into the bower, But my lady first did go⁠—</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-430"/>
			<p>Ay hand in hand into the bower, Where my Lord’s roses blow.</p>
			<p>My lady’s maid had a silken scarf,</p>
			<p>And a golden ring had she, And a kiss from the stranger, as off he went</p>
			<p>Again on his palfr’ey.</p>
			<p>Asleep ! O sleep a little while, white pearl And let me kneel, and let me pray to thee, And let me call Heaven’s blessing on thine eyes, And let me breathe into the happy air, That doth enfold and touch thee all about, Vows or my slavery, my giving up. My sudden adoration, my great love 1</p>
			<p>IIL FAMILIAR VERSES STANZAS TO MISS WYLIE</p>
			<p>O COME, Georgiana ! the rose is full blown. The riches of Flora are lavishly strown, The air is all softness, and crystal the streams; The West is resplendently clothed in beams.</p>
			<p>O come ! let us haste to the freshening shades, The quaintly carv’d seats, and the opening glades; Where the faeries are chanting their evening hymns. And the last sun-beam the sylph lightly swims.</p>
			<p>And when thou art weary, I ’11 find thee a bed Of mosses and flowers to pillow thy head : And there Georgiana I ’11 sit at thy feet. While my story of love I enraptur’d repeat.</p>
			<p>So fondly I ’11 breathe, and so softly I ’11 sigh, Thou wilt think that some amorous zephyr is nigh ;</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-431"/>
			<p>Yet no⁠—as I breathe I will press thy fair knee, And then thou wilt know that the sigh comes from me.</p>
			<p>Ah! why, dearest girl, should we lose all these blisses? That mortal’s a fool who such happiness misses : So smile acquiescence, and give me thy hand, With love-looking eyes, and with voice sweetly bland.</p>
			<p>EPISTLE TO JOHN HAMILTON REYNOLDS</p>
			<p>Dear Reynolds ! As last night I lay in bed, There came before my eyes that wonted thread Of shapes, and shadows, and remembrances. That every other minute vex and please : Things all disjointed come from north and south⁠—Two Witch’s eyes above a Cherub’s mouth, Voltaire with casque and shield and habergeon, And Alexander with his nightcap on ; Old Socrates a-tying his cravat. And Hazlitt playing with Miss Edgeworth’s cat; i And Junius Brutus, pretty well so so, Making the best of ‘s way towards Soho.</p>
			<p>Few are there who escape these visitings⁠—Perhaps one or two whose lives have patent wings, And thro’ whose curtains peeps no hellish nose, No wild-boar tushes, and no Mermaid’s toes ; But flowers bursting out with lusty pride, And young ^olian harps personify’d ; Some Titian colours touch’d into real life⁠—The sacrifice goes on ; the pontiff knife 2.</p>
			<p>Gleams in the Sun, the milk-white heifer lows, The pipes go shrilly, the libation flows: A white sail shows above the green-head cliff, Moves round the point, and throws her anchor stiff The mariners join hymn with those on land.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-432"/>
			<p>You know the Enchanted Castle⁠—it doth stand Upon a rock, on the border of a Lake, Nested in trees, which all do seem to shake From some old magic-like Urganda’s sword. O Phoebus ! that I had thy sacred word 30</p>
			<p>To show this Castle, in fair dreaming wise,: Unto my friend, while sick and ill he lies !</p>
			<p>You know it well enough, where it doth seem A mossy place, a Merlin’s Hall, a dream ; You know the clear Lake, and the little Isles, The mountains blue, and cold near neighbour rills, All which elsewhere are but half animate ; There do they look alive to love and hate, To smiles and frowns ; they seem a lifted mound Above some giant, pulsing underground. 40</p>
			<p>Part of the building was a chosen See, Built by a banish’d Santon of Chaldee ; The other part, two thousand years from him, “Was built by Cuthbert de Saint Aldebrim ; Then there ‘s a little wing, far from the Sun, Built by a Lapland Witch turn’d maudlin Nun; And many other juts of aged stone Founded with many a mason-devil’s groan.</p>
			<p>The doors all look as if they op’d themselves: The windows as if latch’d by Fays and Elves, 50 And from them comes a silver flash of light, As from the westward of a Summer’s night; Or like a beauteous woman’s large blue eyesj Gone mad through olden songs and poesies.</p>
			<p>See ! what is coming from the distance dim ! j</p>
			<p>A golden Galley all in silken trim ! *</p>
			<p>Three rows of oars are lightning, moment whiles Into the verd’rous bosoms of those isles; Towards the shade, under the Castle wall, It comes in silence⁠—now ‘t is hidden all. 60</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-433"/>
			<p>The Clarion sounds, and from a Postern-gate An echo of sweet music doth create A fear in the poor Herdsman who doth bring His beasts to trouble the enchanted spring⁠—He tells of the sweet music, and the spot, To all his friends, and they believe him not.</p>
			<p>O that our dreamings all, of sleep or wake, Would all their colours from the sunset take: From something of material sublime. Rather than shadow our own soul’s day-time 70</p>
			<p>In the dark void of night. For in the world We jostle⁠—but my flag is not unfurl’d On the Admiral-staff⁠—and so philosophise I dare not yet ! O, never will the prize, High reason, and the love of good and ill, Be my award ! Things cannot to the will Be settled, but they tease us out of thought; Or is it imagination brought Beyond its proper bound, yet still confin’d, Lost in a sort of Purgatory blind, 80</p>
			<p>Cannot refer to any standard law Of either earth or heaven ? It is a flaw In happiness, to see beyond our bourn. — It forces us in summer skies to mourn. It spoils the singing of the Nightingale.</p>
			<p>Dear Reynolds ! I have a mysterious tale, And cannot speak it: the first page I read Upon a Lampit rock of green sea-weed Among the breakers ; ‘t was a quiet eve, The rocks were silent, the wide sea did weave 90 An untumultuous fringe of silver foam Along the flat brown sand ; I was at home And should have been most happy⁠—but I saw Too far into the sea, where every maw The greater on the less feeds evermore. — But I saw too distinct into the core</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-434"/>
			<p>Of an eternal fierce destruction,</p>
			<p>And so from happiness I far was gone.</p>
			<p>Still am I sick of it, and tho’ to-day,</p>
			<p>I ‘ve gather’d young spring-leaves, and flowers gay</p>
			<p>Of periwinkle and wild straw^berry, loi</p>
			<p>Still do I that most fierce destruction see,</p>
			<p>The Shark at savage prey⁠—the Hawk at</p>
			<p>pounce⁠—The gentle Robin, like a Pard or Ounce, Ravening a worm⁠—Away, ye horrid moods ! Moods of one’s mind ! You know I hate them well. You know I ‘d sooner be a clapping Bell To some Kamschatkan Missionary Church, Than with these horrid moods be left i’ the lurch.</p>
			<p>A DRAUGHT OF SUNSHINE</p>
			<p>Hence Burgundy, Claret, and Port,</p>
			<p>Away with old Hock and Madeira, Too earthly ye are for my sport;</p>
			<p>There’s a beverage brighter and clearer. Instead of a pitiful rummer, My wine overbrims a whole summer;</p>
			<p>My bowl is the sky.</p>
			<p>And I drink at my eye,</p>
			<p>Till I feel in the brain</p>
			<p>A Delphian pain⁠—Then follow, my Caius ! then follow :</p>
			<p>On the green of the hill</p>
			<p>We will drink our fill</p>
			<p>Of golden sunshine,</p>
			<p>Till our brains intertwine With the glory and grace of Apollo ! God of the Meridian,</p>
			<p>And of the East and West, To thee my soul is flown,</p>
			<p>And my body is earthward press’d. — It is an awful mission, A terrible division;</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-435"/>
			<p>And leaves a gulf austere To be fill’d with worldly fear. Aye, when the soul is fled To high above our head, Affrighted do we gaze After its airy maze, As doth a mother wild, When her young infant child Is in an eagle’s claws⁠—And is not this the cause Of madness ?⁠—God of Song, Thou bearest me along Through sights I scarce can bear : O let me, let me share With the hot lyre and thee. The staid Philosophy. Temper my lonely hours, And let me see thy bowers More unalarm’d !</p>
			<p>AT TEIGNMOUTH</p>
			<p>Here all the summer could I stay, For there’s Bishop’s teign And King’s teign</p>
			<p>And Coomb at the clear teign head-Where close by the stream You may have your cream</p>
			<p>All spread upon barley bread.</p>
			<p>There ‘s arch Brook</p>
			<p>And there’s larch Brook Both turning many a mill ;</p>
			<p>And cooling the drouth</p>
			<p>Of the salmon’s mouth And fattening his silver gill.</p>
			<p>There is Wild wood, A Mild hood</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-436"/>
			<p>To the sheep on the lea o’ the down,</p>
			<p>Where the golden furze</p>
			<p>With its green, thin spurs, Doth catch at the maiden’s gown.</p>
			<p>There is Newton marsh</p>
			<p>With its spear grass harsh⁠—A pleasant summer level</p>
			<p>Where the maidens sweet</p>
			<p>Of the Market Street, Do meet in the dusk to revel.</p>
			<p>There’s the Barton rich</p>
			<p>With dyke and ditch And hedge for the thrush to live in ;</p>
			<p>And the hollow tree</p>
			<p>For the buzzing bee, And a bank for the wasp to hive in.</p>
			<p>And O, and O</p>
			<p>The daisies blow And the primroses are waken’d,</p>
			<p>And the violets white</p>
			<p>Sit in silver plight. And the green bud’s as long as the spike end.</p>
			<p>Then who would go</p>
			<p>Into dark Soho, And chatter with dack’d hair’d critics,</p>
			<p>When he can stay</p>
			<p>For the new-mown hay, And startle the dappled Prickets ?</p>
			<p>THE DEVON MAID</p>
			<p>Where be ye going, you Devon Maid ?</p>
			<p>And what have ye there in the Basket ? Ye tight little fairy just fresh from the dairy.</p>
			<p>Will ye give me some cream if I ask it ?</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-437"/>
			<p>I love your Meads, and I love your flowers,</p>

			<p>I love your hills, and I love your dales,</p>
			<p>And I love your flocks a-bleating⁠—But O, on the heather to lie together, [ With both our hearts a-beating !</p>

			<p>MEG MERRILIES</p>
			<p>Old Meg she was a Gipsy,</p>
			<p>And liv’d upon the Moors: Her bed it was the brown heath turf,</p>
			<p>And her house was out of doors.</p>
			<p>Her apples were swart blackberries,</p>
			<p>Her currants pods o’ broom; Her wine was dew of the wild white rose,</p>
			<p>Her book a churchyard tomb.</p>
			<p>Her Brothers were the craggy hills,</p>
			<p>Her Sisters larchen trees⁠—Alone with her great family</p>
			<p>She liv’d as she did please.</p>
			<p>No breakfast had she many a morn,</p>
			<p>No dinner many a noon, And ‘stead of supper she would stare</p>
			<p>Full hard against the Moon.</p>
			<p>But every morn of woodbine fresh</p>
			<p>She made her garlanding, And every night the dark glen Yew</p>
			<p>She wove, and she would sing.</p>
			<p>And with her fingers old and brown</p>
			<p>She plaited Mats o’ Rushes, And gave them to the Cottagers</p>
			<p>She met among the Bushes,</p>
			<p>Old Meg was brave as Margaret Queen And tall as Amazon :</p>

			<p>TO THOMAS KEATS Belantbee (for Ballantree) July 10 [1818.]</p>
			<p>Ah ! ken ye what I met the day</p>
			<p>Out oure the Mountains A coming down by craggies gray</p>
			<p>An mossie fountains⁠—Ah goud-hair’d Marie yeve I pray</p>
			<p>Ane minute’s guessing⁠—For that I met upon the way</p>
			<p>Is past expressing. As I stood where a rocky brig</p>
			<p>A torrent crosses I spied upon a misty rig</p>
			<p>A troup o’ Horses⁠—And as they trotted down the glen</p>
			<p>I sped to meet them To see if I might know the Men</p>
			<p>To stop and greet them. First Willie on his sleek mare came</p>
			<p>At canting gallop, His long hair rustled like a flame</p>
			<p>On board a shallop, Then came his brother Rab and then</p>
			<p>Young Peggy’s Mither</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-443"/>
			<p>And Peggy too⁠—adown the glen</p>
			<p>They went togither⁠—I saw her wrappit in her hood</p>
			<p>Frae wind and raining⁠—Her cheek was flush wi’ timid blood</p>
			<p>Twixt growth and waning⁠—She tiirn’d her dazed eyes full oft</p>
			<p>For there her Brithers Came riding with her Bridegroom soft</p>
			<p>And mony ithers. Young Tarn came up and eyed me quick</p>
			<p>With reddened cheek⁠—Braw Tom was daffed like a chick⁠—</p>
			<p>He couldna speak⁠—Ah, Marie, they are all gane hame</p>
			<p>Through blustering weather An’ every heart is full on flame</p>
			<p>An’ light as feather. Ah ! Marie, they are all gone hame</p>
			<p>Frae happy wadding. Whilst I⁠—Ah is it not a shame ?</p>
			<p>Sad tears am shedding.</p>

			<p>That Gods might know my own particular taste :</p>
			<p>First the soft Bag-pipe mourn’d with zealous haste. The Stranger next with head on bosom bent Sigh’d ; rueful again the piteous Bag-pipe went.</p>
			<p>Again the Stranger sighings fresh did waste.</p>
			<p>O Bag-pipe, thou didst steal my heart away⁠—O Stranger, thou my nerves from Pipe didst charm⁠—</p>
			<p>O Bag-pipe thou didst re-assert thy sway⁠—Again thou. Stranger, gav’st me fresh alarm⁠—</p>
			<p>Alas ! I could not choose. Ah ! my poor heart</p>

			<p>LINES WRITTEN IN THE HIGHLANDS AFTER A VISIT TO BURNS’S COUNTRY</p>
			<p>There is a charm in footing slow across a silent</p>
			<p>plain, Where patriot battle has been fought, where glory-had the gain; There is a pleasure on the heath where Druids old</p>
			<p>have been, Where mantles gray have rustled by and swept the</p>
			<p>nettles green ; There is Joy in every spot made known by times of</p>
			<p>old, New to the feet, although each tale a hundred times</p>
			<p>be told; There is a deeper Joy than all, more solemn in the</p>
			<p>heart, More parching to the tongue than all, of more divine</p>
			<p>a smart, When weary steps forget themselves upon a pleasant</p>
			<p>turf, Upon hot sand, or flinty road, or sea-shore iron scurf, Toward the Castle or the Cot, where long ago was</p>
			<p>born II</p>
			<p>One who was great through mortal days, and died</p>
			<p>of fame unshorn. Light heather-bells may tremble then, but they are</p>
			<p>far away ; Wood-lark may sing from sandy fern⁠—the Sun</p>
			<p>may hear his Lay ; Runnels may kiss the grass on shelves and shallows</p>
			<p>clear. But their low voices are not heard, though come on</p>
			<p>travels drear ; Blood-red the s\m may set behind black mountain</p>
			<p>peaks ; Blue tides may sluice and drench their time in Caves</p>
			<p>and weedy creeks;</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-447"/>
			<p>Eagles may seem to sleep wing-wide upon the Air; Ring-doves may fly conviils’d across to some higli-</p>
			<p>cedar’d lair ; 20</p>
			<p>But the forgotten eye is still fast lidded to the</p>
			<p>ground, As Palmer’s, that with weariness, mid-desert shrine</p>
			<p>hath found.</p>
			<p>At such a time the soul’s a child, in childhood is</p>
			<p>the brain ; Forgotten is the worldly heart⁠—alone, it heats in</p>
			<p>vain. — Aye, if a Madman could have leave to pass a healthful day To tell his forehead’s swoon and faint when first</p>
			<p>began decay, He might make tremble many a one whose spirit had</p>
			<p>gone forth To find a Bard’s low cradle-place about the silent</p>
			<p>North. Scanty the hour and few the steps beyond the bourn</p>
			<p>of Care, Beyond the sweet and bitter world⁠—beyond it</p>
			<p>unaware! 30</p>
			<p>Scanty the hour and few the steps, because a longer</p>
			<p>stay Would bar return, and make a man forget his mortal</p>
			<p>way: O horrible! to lose the sight of well remember’d</p>
			<p>face, Of Brother’s eyes, of Sister’s brow⁠—constant to</p>
			<p>every place; Filling the Air, as on we move, with Portraiture</p>
			<p>intense; More warm than those heroic tints that pain a</p>
			<p>Painter’s sense. When shapes of old come striding by, and visages</p>
			<p>of old.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-448"/>
			<p>Locks shining black, liair scanty gray, and passions</p>
			<p>manifold. No, no, that horror cannot be, for at the cable’s</p>
			<p>length Man feels the gentle anchor pull and gladdens in its</p>
			<p>strength :⁠—40 “</p>
			<p>One hour, half-idiot, he stands by mossy water-fall. But in the very next he reads his soul’s Memorial:⁠—He reads it on the mountain’s height, where chance</p>
			<p>he may sit down Upon rough marble diadem⁠—that hill’s eternal</p>
			<p>Crown. Yet be his Anchor e’er so fast, room is there for a</p>
			<p>prayer That man may never lose his Mind on Mountains</p>
			<p>black and bare ; That he may stray league after league some great</p>
			<p>birthplace to find And keep his vision clear from speck, his inward</p>
			<p>sight unblind.</p>
			<p>MRS. CAMERON AND BEN NEVIS</p>
			<p>After all there was one Mrs. Cameron of 50 years of age and the fattest woman in all Inverness-shire who got up this Mountain some few years ago⁠—true she had her servants⁠—but then she had herself. She ought to have hired Sisyphus⁠—‘Up the high hill he heaves a huge round⁠—Mrs. Cameron.’ ‘T is said a little conversation took place between the mountain and the Lady. After taking a glass of Whisky as she was tolerably seated at ease she thus began⁠—</p>
			<p>MRS. C.</p>
			<p>Upon my life Sir Nevis I am piqued That I have so far panted tugg’d and reek’d To do an honor to your old bald pate And now am sitting on you j ust to bait, Without your paying me one compliment.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-449"/>
			<p>Alas, ‘t is so with all, when our intent Is plain, and in the eye of all Mankind We fair ones show a preference, too blind! You Gentle man immediately turn tail⁠—</p>
			<p>0 let me then my hapless fate bewail! lo Ungrateful Baldpate have I not disdain’d</p>
			<p>The pleasant Valleys⁠—have I not madbrain’d</p>
			<p>Deserted all my Pickles and preserves</p>
			<p>My China closet too⁠—with wretched Nerves</p>
			<p>To boot⁠—say, wretched ingrate, have I not</p>
			<p>Left my soft cushion chair and caudle pot ?</p>
			<p>‘T is true I had no corns⁠—no! thank the fates</p>
			<p>My Shoemaker was always Mr, Bates.</p>
			<p>And if not Mr. Bates why I ‘m not old!</p>
			<p>Still dumb ungrateful Nevis⁠—still so cold ! 20</p>
			<p>Here the Lady took some more whisky and was putting even more to her lips when she dashed it to the Ground, for the Moimtain began to grumble⁠—which continued for a few minutes before he thus began⁠—</p>
			<p>BEN NEVIS</p>
			<p>What whining bit of tongue and Mouth thus dares</p>
			<p>Disturb my slumber of a thousand years ?</p>
			<p>Even so long my sleep has been secure⁠—</p>
			<p>And to be so awak’d I ’11 not endure.</p>
			<p>Oh pain⁠—for since the Eagle’s earliest scream</p>
			<p>1 ‘ve had a damn’d confounded ugly dream,</p>
			<p>A Nightmare sure. What! Madam, was it you ? It cannot be ! My old eyes are not true 1 Red-Crag, my Spectacles ! Now let me see ! Good Heavens! Lady, how the gemini 30</p>
			<p>Did you get here ? O, I shall split my sides ! I shall earthquake⁠—</p>
			<p>Sweet Nevis do not quake, for though I love Your honest Countenance all things above.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-450"/>
			<p>Truly I should not like to be convey’d So far into your Bosom⁠—gentle Maid Loves not too rough a treatment, gentle Sir⁠—Pray thee be calm and do not quake nor stir No, not a Stone, or I shall go in fits⁠—</p>
			<p>BEN NEVIS</p>
			<p>I must⁠—I shall⁠—I meet not such tit bits⁠—40</p>
			<p>I meet not such sweet creatures every day⁠—By my old nightcap night and day I must have one sweet Buss⁠—I must and shall! Red Crag !⁠—What! Madam, can you then repent Of all the toil and vigour you have spent To see Ben Nevis and to touch his nose ? Red Crag I say ! O I must have them close! Red Crag, there lies beneath my farthest toe A vein of Sulphur⁠—go, dear Red Crag, go⁠—And rub your flinty back against it⁠—budge ! 50 Dear Madam, I must kiss you, faith I must! I must embrace you with my dearest gust! Block-head, d’ ye hear !⁠—Block-head, I ’11 make her</p>
			<p>feel. There lies beneath my east leg’s northern heel A cave of young earth dragons ;⁠—well my boy Go thither quick and so complete my joy. Take you a bundle of the largest pines. And when the sun on fiercest Phosphor shines, Fire them and ram them in the Dragon’s nest, Then will the dragons fry and fizz their best 60</p>
			<p>Until ten thousand now no bigger than Poor alligators⁠—poor things of one span⁠—Will each one swell to twice ten times the size Of northern whale⁠—then for the tender prize⁠—The moment then⁠—for then will Red Crag rub His flinty back⁠—and I shall kiss and snub And press my dainty morsel to my breast. Block-head make haste!</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-451"/>
			<p>O Muses, weep the rest⁠—The Lady fainted and he thought her dead; So pulled the clouds again about his head 70</p>
			<p>And went to sleep again; soon she was rous’d By her affrighted servants⁠—next day, hous’d Safe on the lowly ground she bless’d her fate That fainting fit was not delayed too late.</p>
			<p>But what surprised me above all is how the lady got down again. I felt it horribly. ‘T was the most vile descent⁠—shook me all to pieces.</p>
			<p>SHARING EVE’S APPLE</p>
			<p>O BLUSH not so ! O blush not so !</p>
			<p>Or I shall think you knowing ; And if you smile the blushing while,</p>
			<p>Then maidenheads are going.</p>
			<p>There’s a blush for won’t, and a blush for shan’t,</p>
			<p>And a blush for having done it : There’s a blush for thought and a blush for nought,</p>
			<p>And a blush for just begun it.</p>
			<p>O sigh not so! O sigh not so!</p>
			<p>For it sounds of Eve’s sweet Pippin ; By these loosen’d lips you have tasted the pips</p>
			<p>And fought in an amorous nipping.</p>
			<p>Will you play once more at nice-cut-core,</p>
			<p>For it only will last our youth out, And we have the prime of the kissing time,</p>
			<p>We have not one sweet tooth out.</p>
			<p>There’s a sigh for yes, and a sigh for no,</p>
			<p>And a sigh for I can’t bear it! O what can be done, shall we stay or run ?</p>
			<p>O cut the sweet apple and share it!</p>

			<p>When they were come into the Faery’s Court They rang⁠—no one at home⁠—all gone to sport And dance and kiss and love as faeries do For Faeries be as humans lovers true. Amid the woods they were so lone and wild. Where even the Robin feels himself exil’d. And where the very brooks, as if afraid, Hurry along to some less magic shade. ‘ No one at home !’ the fretful Princess cry’d ; * And all for nothing such a dreary ride, And all for nothing my new diamond cross; No one to see my Persian feathers toss. No one to see my Ape, my Dwarf, my Fool, Or how I pace my Otaheitan mule.</p>

			<p>He was a Prince, the Fool, a grown-up Prince,</p>
			<p>But he has never been a King’s son since</p>
			<p>He fell a snoring at a faery Ball.</p>
			<p>Yon poor Ape was a Prince, and he poor thing</p>
			<p>Picklock’d a faery’s boudoir⁠—now no king</p>
			<p>But ape⁠—so pray your highness stay awhile,</p>
			<p>‘T is sooth indeed, we know it to our sorrow⁠—</p>
			<p>Persist and you may be an ape to-morrow.’ 40</p>
			<p>While the Dwarf spake, the Princess, all for spite,</p>
			<p>Peel’d the brown hazel twig to lily white,</p>
			<p>Clench’d her small teeth, and held her lips apart,</p>
			<p>Try’d to look unconcern’d with beating heart.</p>
			<p>They saw her highness had made up her mind,</p>
			<p>A-quavering like the reeds before the wind⁠—</p>
			<p>And they had had it, but O happy chance !</p>
			<p>The Ape for very fear began to dance</p>
			<p>And grinn’d as all his ugliness did ache⁠—</p>
			<p>She staid her vixen fingers for his sake, 50</p>
			<p>He was so very ugly : then she took</p>
			<p>Her pocket-mirror and began to look</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-455"/>
			<p>First at herself and then at him, and then</p>
			<p>She smil’d at her own beauteous face again.</p>
			<p>Yet for all this⁠—for all her pretty face⁠—</p>
			<p>She took it in her head to see the place.</p>
			<p>Women gain little from experience</p>
			<p>Either in Lovers, husbands, or expense.</p>
			<p>The more their beauty the more fortune too⁠—</p>
			<p>Beauty before the wide world never knew⁠—60</p>
			<p>So each fair reasons⁠—tho’ it oft miscarries.</p>
			<p>She thought her pretty face would please the faeries.</p>
			<p>‘ My darling Ape, I wont whip you to-day,</p>
			<p>Give me the Picklock sirrah and go play.’</p>
			<p>They all three wept but counsel was as vain</p>
			<p>As crying cup biddy to drops of rain.</p>
			<p>Yet lingering by did the sad Ape forth draw</p>
			<p>The Picklock from the Pocket in his Jaw.</p>
			<p>The Princess took it, and dismounting straight</p>
			<p>Tripp’d in blue silver’d slippers to the gate 70</p>
			<p>And touch’d the wards, the Door full courteous</p>
			<p>Opened⁠—she enter’d with her servants three.</p>
			<p>Again it clos’d and there was nothing seen</p>
			<p>But the Mule grazing on the herbage green.</p>
			<p>End of Canto XII.</p>
			<p>CANTO THE XIII</p>
			<p>The Mule no sooner saw himself alone</p>
			<p>Than he prick’d up his Ears⁠—and said ‘ well done;</p>
			<p>At least unhappy Prince I may be free⁠—</p>
			<p>No more a Princess shall side-saddle me.</p>
			<p>0 King of Otaheite⁠—tho’ a Mule,</p>
			<p>“Aye, every inch a King”⁠—tho’ “Fortune’s</p>
			<p>Fool,” Well done⁠—for by what Mr. Dwarfy said</p>
			<p>1 would not give a sixpence for her head.’ Even as he spake he trotted in high glee</p>
			<p>To the knotty side of an old Pollard tree, 10</p>
			<p>And rubb’d his sides against the mossed bark</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-456"/>
			<p>Till his Girths burst and left him naked stark Except his Bridle⁠—how get rid of that Buckled and tied with many a twist and plait. At last it struck him to pretend to sleep, And then the thievish Monkeys down would creep And filch the unpleasant trammels quite away. No sooner thought of than adown he lay, Shamm’d a good snore⁠—the Monkey-men descended And whom they thought to injure they befriended. They hung his Bridle on a topmost bough 21</p>
			<p>And off he went run, trot, or anyhow⁠—</p>
			<p>SPENSERIAN STANZAS ON CHARLES ARMITAGE BROWN</p>
			<p>He is to weet a melancholy Carle : Thin in the waist, with bushy head of hair, As hath the seeded thistle when in parle It holds the Zephyr, ere it sendeth fair Its light balloons into the summer air; There to his beard had not begun to bloom. No brush had touch’d his chin, or razor sheer; No care had touched his cheek with mortal doom. But new he was, and bright, as scarf from Persian loom,</p>
			<p>Ne cared he for wine, or half-and-half; Ne cared he for fish, or flesh, or fowl; And sauces held he worthless as the chaff; He’s deigned the swineherd at the wassail bowl; Ne with lewd ribbalds sat he cheek by jowl; Ne with sly Lemans in the scorner’s chair ; But after water-brooks this Pilgrim’s soul Panted, and all his food was woodland air; Though he would oft-times feast on gilliflowers rare.</p>
			<p>The slang of cities in no wise he knew ; Tipping the wink to him was heathen Greek ;</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-457"/>
			<p>He sipp’d no ‘olden Tom,’ or ‘ruin blue,’ Or Nantz, or cherry-brandy, drunk full meek By many a Damsel hoarse, and rouge of cheek ; Nor did he know each aged Watchman’s beat, Nor in obscured purlieus would he seek For curled Jewesses, with ankles neat, Who, as they walk abroad, make tinkling with their feet.</p>

			<p>TO GEORGE KEATS WRITTEN IN SICKNESS</p>
			<p>Brother, belov’d if health shall smile again, Upon this wasted form and fever’d cheek: If e’er returning vigour bid these weak</p>
			<p>And languid limbs their gladsome strength regain.</p>
			<p>Well may thy brow the placid glow retain Of sweet content and thy pleas’d eye may speak</p>
