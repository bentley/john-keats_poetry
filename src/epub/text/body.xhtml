			<h1>The Poems of John Keats</h1>
			<p>VERSES TO FANNY BRAWNE SONNET</p>
			<p>The day is gone, and all its sweets are gone!</p>
			<p>Sweet voice, sweet lips, soft hand, and softer breast. Warm breath, light whisper, tender semi-tone,</p>
			<p>Bright eyes, accomplish’d shape, and lang’rous waist! Faded the flower and all its budded charms.</p>
			<p>Faded the sight of beauty from my eyes, Faded the shape of beauty from my arms.</p>
			<p>Faded the voice, warmth, whiteness, paradise! Vanish’d unseasonably at shut of eve.</p>
			<p>When the dusk holiday⁠—or holinight⁠—Of fragrant-curtain’d love begins to weave</p>
			<p>The woof of darkness thick, for hid delight: But, as I ‘ve read love’s missal through to-day, He ’11 let me sleep, seeing I fast and pray.</p>
			<p>LINES TO FANNY</p>
			<p>What can I do to drive away</p>
			<p>Remembrance from my eyes ? for they have seen,</p>
			<p>Aye, an hour ago, my brilliant Queen !</p>
			<p>Touch has a memory. O say, love, say,</p>
			<p>What can I do to kill it and be free</p>
			<p>In my old liberty ?</p>
			<p>When every fair one that I saw was fair,</p>
			<p>Enough to catch me in but half a snare.</p>
			<p>Not keep me there:</p>
			<p>When, howe’er poor or particolour’d things.</p>
			<p>My muse had wings.</p>
			<p>And ever ready was to take her course</p>
			<p>Whither I bent her force,</p>

			<p>38o VERSES TO FANNY BRAWNE</p>
			<p>Unintellectiial, yet divine to me;⁠—Divine, I say !⁠—Wliat sea-bird o’er tlie sea Is a philosopher the while he goes Winging along where the great water throes ?</p>
			<p>How shall I do</p>
			<p>To get anew Those moulted feathers, and so mount once more</p>
			<p>Above, above</p>
			<p>The reach of fluttering Love, And make him cower lowly while I soar ? Shall I gulp wine ? No, that is vulgarism, A heresy and schism.</p>
			<p>Foisted into the canon law of love ;⁠—No⁠—wine is only sweet to happy men ;</p>
			<p>More dismal cares</p>
			<p>Seize on me unawares⁠—Where shall I learn to get my piece again ?-To banish thoughts of that most hateful land, Dungeoner of my friends, that wicked strand Where they were wreck’d and live a wrecked life; That monstrous region, whose dull rivers pour, Ever from their sordid urns unto the shore, Unown’d of any weedy-haired gods ; Whose winds, all zephyrless, hold scourging rods. Iced in the great lakes, to afiiict mankind ; Whose rank-grown forests, frosted, black, and blind, Would fright a Dryad; whose harsh herbaged</p>
			<p>meads Make lean and lank the starved ox while he feeds; There bad flowers have no scent, birds no sweet</p>
			<p>song. And great unerring Nature once seems wrong.</p>
			<p>O, for some sunny spell</p>
			<p>To dissipate the shadows of this hell!</p>
			<p>Say they are gone⁠—with the new dawning light</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-381"/>
			<p>O, let me once more rest</p>
			<p>My soul upon that dazzling breast!</p>
			<p>Let once again these aching arms be placed,</p>
			<p>The tender gaolers of thy waist !</p>
			<p>And let me feel that warm breath here and there</p>
			<p>To spread a rapture in my very hair⁠—</p>
			<p>O, the sweetness of the pain !</p>
			<p>Give me those lips again !</p>
			<p>Enough ! Enough ! it is enough for me</p>
			<p>To dream of thee !</p>
			<p>TO FANNY</p>
			<p>I CRY your mercy⁠—pity⁠—love⁠—aye, love !</p>
			<p>Merciful love that tantalizes not, One-thoughted, never-wandering, guileless love,</p>
			<p>Unmask’d, and being seen⁠—without a blot ! O ! let me have thee whole⁠—all⁠—all⁠—be mine !</p>
			<p>That shape, that fairness, that sweet minor zest Of love, your kiss⁠—those hands, those eyes divine,</p>
			<p>That warm, white, lucent, million - pleasured breast⁠—Yourself⁠—your soul⁠—in pity give me all,</p>
			<p>Withhold no atom’s atom, or I die. Or living on perhaps, your wretched thrall,</p>
			<p>Forget, in the mist of idle misery, Life’s purposes⁠—the palate of my mind Losing its gust, and my ambition blind!</p>

			<p>THE CAP AND BELLS</p>
			<p>OR, THE JEALOUSIES</p>
			<p>A Faery Tale. Unfinished</p>
			<p>In midmost Ind, beside Hydaspes cool,</p>
			<p>There stood, or hover’d, tremulous in the air,</p>
			<p>A faery city, ’neath the potent rule</p>
			<p>Of Emperor Elfinan; fam’d ev’rywhere</p>
			<p>For love of mortal women, maidens fair.</p>
			<p>Whose lips were solid, whose soft hands were</p>
			<p>made Of a fit mould and beauty, ripe and rare, To pamper his slight wooing, warm yet staid : He loved girls smooth as shades, but hated a mere</p>
			<p>shade.</p>
			<p>This was a crime forbidden by the law ;</p>
			<p>And all the priesthood of his city wept.</p>
			<p>For ruin and dismay they well foresaw.</p>
			<p>If impious prince no bound or limit kept.</p>
			<p>And faery Zendervester overstept;</p>
			<p>They wept, he sinn’d, and still he would sin on,</p>
			<p>They dreamt of sin, and he sinn’d while they</p>
			<p>slept ; In vain the pulpit thunder’d at the throne, Caricature was vain, and vain the tart lampoon.</p>
			<p>Which seeing, his high court of parliament Laid a remonstrance at his Highness’ feet, Praying his royal senses to content Themselves with what in faery land was sweet. Befitting best that shade with shade should meet Whereat, to calm their fears, he promised soon</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-383"/>
			<p>From mortal tempters all to make retreat⁠—Ay, even on the first of the new moon, An immaterial wife to espouse as heaven’s boon.</p>
			<p>Meantime he sent a fluttering embassy To Pigmio, of Imaus sovereign, To half beg, and half demand, respectfully, The hand of his fair daughter Bellanaine ; An audience had, and speeching done, they gain Their point, and bring the weeping bride away; Whom, with but one attendant, safely lain Upon their wings, they bore in bright array, While little harps were touch’d by many a lyric fay.</p>
			<p>As in old pictures tender cherubim A child’s soul thro’ the sapphired canvas bear, So, thro’ a real heaven, on they swim With the sweet princess on her plumaged lair, Speed giving to the winds her lustrous hair ; And so she journey’d, sleeping or awake, Save when, for healthful exercise and air, She chose to ‘ promener a I’aile,’ or take A pigeon’s somerset, for sport or change’s sake.</p>
			<p>‘Dear Princess, do not whisper me so loud,’ Quoth Corallina, nurse and confidant, ‘ Do not you see there, lurking in a cloud, Close at your back, that sly old Crafticant ? He hears a whisper plainer than a rant: Dry up your tears, and do not look so blue ; He ‘s Elfinan’s great state-spy militant. He’s running, lying, flying footman, too⁠—Dear mistress, let him have no handle against you !</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-384"/>
			<p>VII</p>
			<p>‘ Show him a mouse’s tail, and he will guess, With metaphysic swiftness, at the mouse ; Show him a garden, and with speed no less, He ’11 surmise sagely of a dwelling-house, And plot, in the same minute, how to chouse The owner out of it; show him a⁠—’ ‘ Peace ! Peace ! nor contrive thy mistress’ ire to rouse !’ Return’d the princess, ‘ my tongue shall not cease Till from this hated match I get a free release.</p>
			<p>VIII</p>
			<p>‘ Ah, beauteous mortal!’ ‘ Hush !’ quoth Coralline, ‘Really you must not talk of him indeed.’ * You hush !’ replied the mistress, with a shine Of anger in her eyes, enough to breed In stouter hearts than nurse’s fear and dread : ‘T was not the glance itself made nursey flinch, But of its threat she took the utmost heed; Not liking in her heart an hour-long pinch, Or a sharp needle run into her back an inch.</p>
			<p>IX</p>
			<p>So she was silenced, and fair Bellanaine, Writhing her little body with ennui, Continued to lament and to complain. That Fate, cross-purposing, should let her be Ravish’d away, far from her dear countree ; That all her feelings should be set at nought. In trumping up this match so hastily. With lowland blood; and lowland blood she thought Poison, as every stanch true-born Imaian ought.</p>
			<p>X</p>
			<p>Sorely she grieved, and wetted three or four White Provence rose-leaves with her faery tears.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-385"/>
			<p>But not for this cause ;⁠—alas ! she had more Bad reasons for her sorrow, as appears In the famed memoirs of a thousand years, Written by Crafticant, and published By Parpaglion and Co., (those sly compeers Who raked up ev’ry fact against the dead,) In Scarab Street, Panthea, at the Jubal’s Head.</p>
			<p>Where, after a long hypercritic howl Against the vicious manners of the age. He goes on to expose, with heart and soul. What vice in this or that year was the rage, Backbiting all the world in every page ; With special strictures on the horrid crime, (Section’d and subsection’d with learning sage,) Of faeries stooping on their wings sublime To kiss a mortal’s lips, when such were in their prime.</p>
			<p>Turn to the copious index, you will find Somewhere in the column, headed letter B, The name of Bellanaine, if you ‘re not blind; Then pray refer to the text, and you will see An article made up of calumny Against this highland princess, rating her For giving way, so over fashionably. To this new-fangled vice, which seems a burr Stuck in his moral throat, no coughing e’er could stir.</p>
			<p>XIII</p>
			<p>There he says plainly that she loved a man ! That she around him flutter’d, flirted, toy’d. Before her marriage with great Elfinan; That after marriage too, she never joy’d In husband’s company, but still employ’d Her wits to ‘scape away to Angle-land ;</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-386"/>
			<p>Where lived the youth, who worried and annoy’d Her tender heart, and its warm ardours fann’d To such a dreadful blaze, her side would scorch her hand.</p>
			<p>XIV</p>
			<p>But let us leave this idle tittle-tattle To waiting-maids, and bed-room coteries, Nor till fit time against her fame wage battle. Poor Elfinan is very ill at ease, Let us resume his subject if you please : For it may comfort and console him much, To rhyme and syllable his miseries ; Poor Elfinan! whose cruel fate was such. He sat and cursed a bride he knew he could not touch.</p>
			<p>XV</p>
			<p>Soon as (according to his promises) The bridal embassy had taken wing. And vanish’d, bird-like, o’er the suburb trees. The emperor, empierced with the sharp sting Of love, retired, vex’d and murmuring Like any drone shut from the fair bee-queen, Into his cabinet, and there did fling His limbs upon the sofa, full of spleen. And damn’d his House of Commons, in complete chagrin.</p>
			<p>XVI</p>
			<p>‘I’ll trounce some of the members,’ cried the</p>
			<p>Prince, ‘ I ’11 put a mark against some rebel names, I’ll make the Opposition-benches wince, I ’11 show them very soon, to all their shames. What ’tis to smother up a Prince’s flames ; That ministers should join in it, I own. Surprises me !⁠—they too at these high games! Am I an Emperor ? Do I wear a crown ? Imperial Elfinan, go hang thyself or drown !</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-387"/>
			<p>XVII</p>
			<p>‘ I ’11 trounce ’em !⁠—there’s the square-cut chancellor,</p>
			<p>His son shall never touch that bishopric ;</p>
			<p>And for the nephew of old Palfior,</p>
			<p>I ’11 show him that his speeches made me sick,</p>
			<p>And give the colonelcy to Phalaric ;</p>
			<p>The tiptoe marquis, moral and gallant,</p>
			<p>Shall lodge in shabby taverns upon tick;</p>
			<p>And for the Speaker’s second cousin’s aunt. She sha’n’t be maid of honour⁠—by heaven that she sha’n’t !</p>
			<p>XVIII</p>
			<p>T ’11 shirk the Duke of A. ; I ’11 cut his brother ;</p>
			<p>I ’11 give no garter to his eldest son;</p>
			<p>I won’t speak to his sister or his mother !</p>
			<p>The Viscount B. shall live at cut-and-run ;</p>
			<p>But how in the world can I contrive to stun</p>
			<p>That fellow’s voice, which plagues me worse than</p>
			<p>any, That stubborn fool, that impudent state-dun. Who sets down ev’ry sovereign as a zany⁠—That vulgar commoner. Esquire Biancopany ?</p>
			<p>* Monstrous affair ! Pshaw! pah ! what ugly</p>
			<p>minx Will they fetch from Imaus for my bride ? Alas 1 my wearied heart within me sinks, To think that I must be so near allied To a cold dullard fay⁠—ah, woe betide! Ah, fairest of all human loveliness ! Sweet Bertha! what crime can it be to glide About the fragrant plaitings of thy dress, Or kiss thine eye, or count thy locks, tress after tress ?’</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-388"/>
			<p>So said, one minute’s while his eyes remain’d Half lidded, piteous, languid, innocent; But, in a wink, their splendour they regain’d, Sparkling revenge with amorous fury blent. Love thwarted in bad temper oft has vent : He rose, he stampt his foot, he rang the bell, And order’d some death-warrants to be sent For signature :⁠—somewhere the tempest fell, As many a poor fellow does not live to tell.</p>
			<p>XXI</p>
			<p>‘ At the same time, Eban,’⁠—(this was his page, A fay of colour, slave from top to toe, Sent as a present, while yet under age, From the Viceroy of Zanguebar⁠—wise, slow. His speech, his only words were ‘ yes’ and ‘ no,’ But swift of look, and foot, and wing was he,)⁠—‘ At the same time, Eban, this instant go To Hum the soothsayer, whose name I see Among the fresh arrivals in our empery.</p>
			<p>XXII</p>
			<p>‘Bring Hum to me! But stay⁠—here take my</p>
			<p>ring. The pledge of favour, that he not suspect Any foul play, or awkward murdering Tho’ I have bow strung many of his sect ; Throw in a hint, that if he should neglect One hour the next shall see him in my grasp. And the next after that shall see him neck’d, Or swallow’d by my hunger-starved asp⁠—And mention (’tis as well) the torture of the wasp.’</p>
			<p>These orders given, the Prince, in half a pet, Let o’er the silk his propping elbow slide,</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-389"/>
			<p>Caught up his little legs, and, in a fret, Fell on the sofa on his royal side, The slave retreated backwards, humble-eyed, And with a slave-like silence closed the door, And to old Hum thro’ street and alley hied ; He ‘ knew the city,’ as we say, of yore, And for short cuts and turns, w^as nobody knew more.</p>
			<p>XXIV</p>
			<p>It was the time when wholesale dealers close Their shutters with a moody sense of wealth, But retail dealers, diligent, let loose The gas (objected to on score of health), Convey’d in little solder’d pipes by stealth, And make it flare in many a brilliant form, That all the powers of darkness it repell’th. Which to the oil-trade doth great scaith and harm, And supersedeth quite the use of the glow-worm.</p>
			<p>Eban, untempted by the pastry-cooks,</p>
			<p>(Of pastry he got store within the palace,)</p>
			<p>With hasty steps, wrapp’d cloak, and solemn looks,</p>
			<p>Incognito upon his errand sallies.</p>
			<p>His smelling-bottle ready for the allies ;</p>
			<p>He pass’d the hurdy-gurdies with disdain,</p>
			<p>Vowing he ‘d have them sent on board the gal</p>
			<p>leys; Just as he made his vow, it ‘gan to rain. Therefore he call’d a coach, and bade it drive amain.</p>
			<p>‘I’ll pull the string,’ said he, and further said, ‘ Polluted Jarvey ! Ah, thou filthy hack ! Whose springs of life are all dried up and dead. Whose linsey-woolsey lining hangs all slack, Whose rug is straw, whose wholeness is a crack</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-390"/>
			<p>And evermore thy steps go clatter-clitter; Whose glass once up can never be got back, Who prov’st, with jolting arguments and bitter, That’t is of modern use to travel in a litter.</p>
			<p>‘ Thou inconvenience ! thou hungry crop For all corn ! thou snail-creeper to and fro, Who while thou goest ever seem’st to stop, And fiddle-faddle standest while you go ; I’ the morning, freighted with a weight of woe, Unto some lazar-house thou journeyest, And in the evening tak’st a double row Of dowdies for some dance or party drest, Besides the goods meanwhile thou movest east and west.</p>
			<p>XXVIII</p>
			<p>‘ By thy ungallant bearing and sad mien, An inch appears the utmost thou couldst budge : Yet at the slightest nod, or hint, or sign, Round to the curb-stone patient dost thou trudge, School’d in a beckon, learned in a nudge, A dull-eyed Argus watching for a fare; Quiet and plodding thou dost bear no grudge To whisking tilburies, or phaetons rare, Curricles, or mail-coaches, swift beyond compare.’</p>
			<p>Philosophizing thus, he pull’d the check. And bade the coachman wheel to such a street, Who turning much his body, more his neck, Louted full low, and hoarsely did him greet: ‘ Certes, Monsieur were best take to his feet. Seeing his servant can no farther drive For press of coaches, that to-night here meet. Many as bees about a straw-capp’d hive, When first for April honey into faint flowers they dive.’</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-391"/>
			<p>XXX</p>
			<p>Eban then paid his fare, and tiptoe went To Hum’s hotel; and, as he on did pass With head inclined, each dusky lineament Show’d in the pearl-paved street as in a glass ; His purple vest, that ever peeping was Rich from the fluttering crimson of his cloak, His silvery trowsers, and his silken sash Tied in a burnish’d knot, their semblance took Upon the mirror’d walls, wherever he might look.</p>
			<p>XXXI</p>
			<p>He smiled at self, and, smiling, show’d his teeth, And seeing his white teeth, he smiled the more; Lifted his eyebrows, spurn’d the path beneath, Show’d teeth again, and smiled as heretofore. Until he knock’d at the magician’s door ; “Where, till the porter answer’d, might be seen. In the clear panel more he could adore⁠—His turban wreathed of gold, and white, and green, Mustachios, ear-ring, nose-ring, and his sabre keen.</p>
			<p>‘ Does not your master give a rout to-night ?’ Quoth the dark page; ‘ Oh, no !’ return’d the</p>
			<p>Swiss, ‘ Next door but one to us, upon the right. The Magazin des Modes now open is Against the Emperor’s wedding;⁠—and, sir, this My master finds a monstrous horrid bore ; As he retired, an hour ago iwis, With his best beard and brimstone, to explore And cast a quiet figure in his second floor.</p>
			<p>XXXIII</p>
			<p>‘ Gad ! he ‘s obliged to stick to business! For chalk, I hear, stands at a pretty price ;</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-392"/>
			<p>And as for aqua vitae⁠—there’s a mess ! The denies sapientice of mice Our barber tells me too are on the rise⁠—Tinder’s a lighter article⁠—nitre pure Goes off like lightning⁠—grains of Paradise At an enormous figure !⁠—stars not sure !⁠—Zodiac will not move without a slight douceur!</p>
			<p>XXXIV</p>
			<p>‘ Venus won’t stir a peg without a fee.</p>
			<p>And master is too partial entre nous</p>
			<p>To⁠—’ ‘Hush⁠—hush!’ cried Eban, ‘sure that</p>
			<p>is he Coming downstairs⁠—by St. Bartholomew 1 As backwards as he can⁠—is’t something new ? Or is ‘t his custom, in the name of fun ?’ ‘He always comes down backward, with one</p>
			<p>shoe’⁠—Return’d the porter⁠—‘ off, and one shoe on, Like, saving shoe for sock or stocking, my mad</p>
			<p>John!’</p>
			<p>XXXV</p>
			<p>It was indeed the great Magician,</p>
			<p>Feeling, with careful toe, for every stair.</p>
			<p>And retrograding careful as he can.</p>
			<p>Backwards and downwards from his own two</p>
			<p>pair: ‘ Salpietro !’ exclaimed Hum, ‘ is the dog there ? He’s always in my way upon the mat!’ * He ‘s in the kitchen, or the Lord knows</p>
			<p>where,’⁠—Replied the Swiss⁠—‘ the nasty, yelping brat!’ ‘ Don’t beat him !’ return’d Hum, and on the floor</p>
			<p>came pat.</p>
			<p>XXXVI</p>
			<p>Then facing right about, he saw the Page,</p>
			<p>And said ; ‘ Don’t tell me what you want, Eban ;-</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-393"/>
			<p>The Emperor is now in a huge rage⁠—’Tis nine to one he’ll give you the rattan ! Let us away !’ Away together ran The plain-dress’d sage and spangled blackamoor, Nor rested till they stood to cool, and fan, And breathe themselves at th’ Emperor’s chamber door. When Eban thought he heard a soft imperial snore.</p>
			<p>XXXVII</p>
			<p>• I thought you guess’d, foretold, or prophesied, That’s Majesty was in a raving fit?’ ‘ He dreams,’ said Hum, ‘ or I have ever lied. That he is tearing you, sir, bit by bit.’ *He ‘s not asleep, and you have little wit,’ Replied the Page, ‘ that little buzzing noise, Whate’er your palmistry may make of it. Comes from a plaything of the Emperor’s choice. From a Man-Tiger-Organ, prettiest of his toys.’</p>
			<p>XXXVIII</p>
			<p>Eban then usher’d in the learned Seer: Elfinan’s back was turn’d, but, ne’ertheless, Both, prostrate on the carpet, ear by ear, Crept silently, and waited in distress, Knowing the Emperor’s moody bitterness; Eban especially, who on the floor ‘gan Tremble and quake to death⁠—he feared less A dose of senna-tea, or nightmare Gorgon, Than the Emperor when he play’d on his Man-Tiger-Organ.</p>
			<p>They kiss’d nine times the carpet’s velvet face Of glossy silk, soft, smooth, and meadow-green. Where the close eye in deep rich fur might trace A silver tissue, scantly to be seen. As daisies lurk’d in June-grass, buds in green ;</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-394"/>
			<p>Sudden the music ceased, sudden the hand Of majesty, by dint of passion keen, Doubled into a common fist, went grand, And knock’d down three cut glasses, and his best ink-stand.</p>
			<p>Then turning round, he saw those trembling two: ‘Eban,’ said he, ‘ as slaves should taste the fruits Of diligence, I shall remember you To-morrow, or next day, as time suits, In a finger conversation with my mutes⁠—Begone !⁠—for you, Chaldean ! here remain ! Fear not, quake not, and as good wine recruits A conjurer’s spirits, what cup will you drain? Sherry in silver, hock in gold, or glass’d champagne ?’</p>
			<p>* Commander of the Faithful!’ answer’d Hum, In preference to these, I ’11 merely taste</p>
			<p>A thimble-full of old Jamaica rum,’</p>
			<p>* A simple boon !’ said Elfinan, ‘ thou may’st Have Nantz, with which my morning-coffee’s</p>
			<p>laced,‘1 ‘ I ’11 have a glass of Nantz, then⁠—said the Seer⁠—</p>
			<p>* Made racy⁠—(sure my boldness is misplaced !)⁠—With the third part⁠—(yet that is drinking</p>
			<p>dear!)⁠—Of the least drop of creme de citron crystal clear.’</p>
			<p>XLII</p>
			<p>* I pledge you. Hum ! and pledge my dearest love, My Bertha !’ ‘ Bertha ! Bertha I’ cried the sage,</p>
			<p>» ‘Mr, Nisby is of opinion that laced coffee is bad for the head.’⁠—Spectator.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-395"/>
			<p>‘ I know a many Berthas !’ ‘ Mine’s above All Berthas ! ‘ sighed the Emperor. * I engage,’ Said Hum, ‘ ia duty, and in vassalage, To mention all the Berthas in the earth ;⁠—There’s Bertha Watson⁠—and Miss Bertha</p>
			<p>Page⁠—This famed for languid eyes, and that for mirth⁠—There ‘s Bertha Blount of York⁠—and Bertha Knox</p>
			<p>of Perth.’</p>
			<p>‘You seem to know’⁠—‘I do know,’ answer’d</p>
			<p>Hum, •Your Majesty ‘s in love with some fine girl Named Bertha; but her surname will not come, Without a little conjuring.’ ‘ ‘T is Pearl, ’Tis Bertha Pearl ! What makes my brain so</p>
			<p>whirl V And she is softer, fairer than her name !’ ‘ Where does she live ?’ ask’d Hum. ‘ Her fair</p>
			<p>locks curl So brightly, they put all our fays to shame !⁠—Live ?⁠—O! at Canterbury, with her old grand</p>
			<p>dame.’</p>
			<p>‘ Good ! good !’ cried Hum, ‘ I ‘ve known her</p>
			<p>from a child ! She is a changeling of my management; She was born at midnight in an Indian wild ; Her mother’s screams with the striped tiger’s</p>
			<p>blent. While the torch-bearing slaves a halloo sent Into the jungles ; and her palanquin, Rested amid the desert’s dreariment, Shook with her agony, till fair were seen The little Bertha’s eyes ope on the stars serene,’</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-396"/>
			<p>‘I can’t say,’ said the monarch, ‘that may be Just as it happen’d, true or else a bam ! Drink up your brandy, and sit down by me, Feel, feel my pulse, how much in love I am ; And if your science is not all a sham, Tell me some means to get the lady here.’ ‘ Upon my honour !’ said the son of Cham.i ‘ She is my dainty changeling, near and dear. Although her story sounds at first a little queer.’</p>
			<p>‘ Convey her to me, Hum, or by my crown,</p>
			<p>My sceptre, and my cross-surmounted globe,</p>
			<p>I’ll knock you⁠—’ ‘Does your majesty mean⁠—</p>
			<p>down f No, no, you never could my feelings probe To such a depth !’ The Emperor took his robe, And wept upon its purple palatine, While Hum continued, shamming half a sob⁠—‘ In Canterbury doth your lady shine ? But let me cool your brandy with a little wine.’</p>

			<p>Whereat a narrow Flemish glass he took, That since belong’d to Admiral De Witt, Admired it with a connoisseuring look. And with the ripest claret crowned it, And, ere the lively head could burst and flit, He turn’d it quickly, nimbly upside down, His mouth being held conveniently fit To catch the treasure : ‘Best in all the town !’ He said, smack’d his moist lips, and gave a pleasant frown.</p>

			<p>* Ah ! good my Prince, weep not!’ And then</p>
			<p>again He fill’d a bumper. ‘ Great Sire, do not weep ! Your pulse is shocking, but I’ll ease your pain.’ ‘ Fetch me that Ottoman, and prithee keep Your voice low,’ said the Emperor, ‘ and steep Some lady’s-fingers nice in Candy wine ; And prithee. Hum, behind the screen do peep For the rose-water vase, magician mine ! And sponge my forehead⁠—so my love doth make me pine.’</p>
			<p>XLIX</p>
			<p>‘ Ah, cursed Bellanaine !’ ‘ Don’t think of her,’ . Rejoin’d the Mago, ‘ but on Bertha muse ; For, by my choicest best barometer, You shall not throttled be in marriage noose; I ‘ve said it. Sire ; you only have to choose Bertha or Bellanaine.’ So saying, he drew From the left pocket of his threadbare hose, A sampler hoarded slyly, good as new ; Holding it by his thumb and finger full in view.</p>
			<p>‘ Sire, this is Bertha Pearl’s neat handywork, Her name, see here. Midsummer, ninety-one’⁠—Elfinan snatch’d it with a sudden jerk, And wept as if he never would have done. Honouring with royal tears the poor homespun ; Whereon were broider’d tigers with black eyes, And long-tailed pheasants, and a rising sun, Plenty of posies, great stags, butterflies Bigger than stags⁠—a moon⁠—with other mysteries.</p>
			<p>The monarch handled o’er and o’er again These day-school hieroglyphics with a sigh;</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-398"/>
			<p>Somewhat in sadness, but pleased in the main,</p>
			<p>Till this oracular couplet met his eye</p>
			<p>Astounded⁠—Cupid, I do thee defy !</p>
			<p>It was too much. He shrunk back in his chair,</p>
			<p>Grew pale as death and fainted⁠—very nigh !</p>
			<p>‘ Pho ! nonsense !’ exclaim’d Hum, ‘ now don’t</p>
			<p>despair : She does not mean it really. Cheer up, hearty⁠—</p>
			<p>there!</p>
			<p>‘ And listen to my words. You say you won’t,</p>
			<p>On any terms, marry Miss Bellanaine ;</p>
			<p>It goes against your conscience⁠—good 1 well,</p>
			<p>don’t. You say, you love a mortal. I would fain Persuade your honour’s highness to refrain From peccadilloes. But, Sire, as I say, What good would that do ? And, to be more</p>
			<p>plain, You would do me a mischief some odd day. Cut off my ears and hands, or head too, by my fay !</p>
			<p>‘ Besides, manners forbid that I should pass any Vile strictures on the conduct of a prince Who should indulge his genius, if he has any, Not, like a subject, foolish matter mince. Now I think on ‘t, perhaps I could convince Your Majesty there is no crime at all In loving pretty little Bertha, since She’s very delicate⁠—not over tall⁠—A fairy’s hand, and in the waist why⁠—very small.’</p>
			<p>‘Eing the repeater, gentle Hum !’ * ‘T is five,’ Said gentle Hum ; ‘ the nights draw in apace ; The little birds I hear are all alive;</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-399"/>
			<p>I see the dawning touch’d upon your face ; Shall I put out the candles, please your Grace ?’ ‘ Do put them out, and, without more ado, Tell me how I may that sweet girl embrace⁠—How you can bring her to me.’ * That’s for you. Great Emperor 1 to adventure, like a lover true.’</p>
			<p>LV</p>
			<p>= * I fetch her !’⁠—‘ Yes, an’t like your Majesty ; And as she would be frighten’d wide awake, To travel such a distance through the sky, Use of some soft manoeuvre you must make. For your convenience, and her dear nerves’ sake ; Nice Way would be to bring her in a swoon, Anon, I ’11 tell you what course were best to take ; You must away this morning.’ ‘ Hum ! so soon ?’</p>
			<p>* Sire, you must be in Kent by twelve o’clock at noon.’</p>
			<p>At this great Csesar started on his feet. Lifted his wings, and stood attentivewise. Those wings to Canterbury you must beat, If you hold Bertha as a worthy prize. Look in the Almanack⁠—Moore never lies⁠—April the twenty-fourth⁠—this coming day. Now breathing its new bloom upon the skies, Will end in St. Mark’s Eve ;⁠—you must away, For on that eve alone can you the maid convey.’</p>
			<p>LVII</p>
			<p>Then the magician solemnly ‘gan to frown, So that his frost-white eye-brows, beetling low, Shaded his deep green eyes, and wrinkles brown Plaited upon his furnace-scorched brow : Forth from his hood that hung his neck below He lifted a bright casket of pure gold, Touch’d a spring-lock, and there in wool or snow,</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-400"/>
			<p>Charm’d into ever freezing, lay an old And legend- leaved book, mysterious to behold.</p>
			<p>LVIII</p>
			<p>‘ Take this same book⁠—it will not bite you, Sire; There, put it underneath your royal arm ; Though it’s a pretty weight, it will not tire, But rather on your journey keep you warm: This is the magic, this the potent charm, That shall drive Bertha to a fainting fit! When the time comes, don’t feel the least alarm But lift her from the ground, and swiftly flit Back to your palace</p>
			<p>LIX</p>
			<p>* What shall I do with that same book ?’ ‘ Why</p>
			<p>merely Lay it on Bertha’s table, close beside Her work-box, and ‘t will help your purpose</p>
			<p>dearly; I say no more.’ ‘ Or good or ill betide. Through the wide air to Kent this morn I glide !’ Exclaim’d the Emperor, ‘ When I return. Ask what you will⁠—I ’11 give you my new</p>
			<p>bride ! And take some more wine. Hum;⁠—O, Heavens!</p>
			<p>I burn To be upon the wing 1 Now, now, that minx I</p>
			<p>spurn !’</p>
			<p>LX</p>
			<p>* Leave her to me,’ rejoin’d the magian :</p>
			<p>‘ But how shall I account, illustrious fay ! For thine imperial absence ? Pho ! I can Say you are very sick, and bar the way To your so loving courtiers for one day ; If either of their two Archbishops’ graces</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-401"/>
			<p>Should talk of extreme unction, I shall say You do not like cold pig with Latin phrases, Which never should be used but in alarming cases.’</p>
			<p>LXI</p>
			<p>* Open the window. Hum ; I ‘m ready now!’ ‘ Zooks!’ exclaim’d Hum, as up the sash he drew, ‘Behold, your Majesty, upon the brow Of yonder hill, what crowds of people !’ ‘ Whew! The monster’s always after something new,’ Return’d his Highness, ‘they are piping hot To see my pigsney Bellanaine. Hum ! do Tighten my belt a little⁠—so, so⁠—not Too tight⁠—the book !⁠—my wand !⁠—so, nothing is forgot.’</p>
			<p>* Wounds ! how they shout !’ said Hum, ‘ and</p>
			<p>there⁠—see, see, Th’ ambassador’s return’d from Pigmio ! The morning’s very fine⁠—uncommonly ! See, past the skirts of yon white cloud they go, Tinging it with soft crimsons ! Now below The sable-pointed heads’of firs and pines They dip, move on, and with them moves a glow Along the forest side ! Now amber lines Reach the hill top, and now throughout the valley</p>
			<p>shines.’</p>
			<p>‘ Why, Hum, you ‘re getting quite poetical! Those nows you managed in a special style.’ ‘ If ever you have leisure. Sire, you shall See scraps of mine will make it worth your while, Tit-bits for Phoebus!⁠—yes, you well may smile. Hark ! hark ! the bells !’ ‘A little further yet, Good Hum, and let me view this mighty coil.’</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-402"/>
			<p>Then the great Emperor full graceful set His elbow for a prop, and snuff’d his mignonette.</p>
			<p>LXIV</p>
			<p>The morn is full of holiday : loud bells With rival clamors ring from every spire; Cunningly-station’d music dies and swells In echoing places ; when the winds respire, Light flags stream out like gauzy tongues of fire ; A metropolitan murmur, lifeful, warm. Comes from the northern suburbs; rich attire Freckles with red and gold the moving swarm ; While here and there clear trumpets blow a keen alarm.</p>
			<p>LXV</p>
			<p>And now the fairy escort was seen clear, Like the old pageant of Aurora’s train, Above a pearl-built minster, hovering near ; First wily Crafticant, the chamberlain. Balanced upon his gray-grown pinions twain, His slender wand officially reveal’d ; Then black gnomes scattering sixpences like rain ; Then pages three and three ; and next, slave-held The Imaian ‘scutcheon bright⁠—one mouse in argent field.</p>
			<p>LXVI</p>
			<p>Gentlemen pensioners next; and after them, A troop of winged Janizaries flew ; Then slaves, as presents bearing many a gem ; Then twelve physicians fluttering two and two ; And next a chaplain in a cassock new ; Then Lords in waiting ; then (what head not reels For pleasure ?)⁠—the fair Princess in full view, Borne upon wings⁠—and very pleased she feels To have such splendour dance attendance at her heels.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-403"/>
			<p>LXVII</p>
			<p>For there was more magnificence behind : She waved her handkerchief. ‘ Ah, very grand !’ Cried Elfinan, and closed the window-blind; ‘ And, Hum, we must not shilly-shally stand⁠—Adieu ! adieu ! I ‘m off for Angle-land ! I say, old Hocus, have you such a thing About you⁠—feel your pockets, I command⁠—I want, this instant, an invisible ring⁠—Thank you, old mummy !⁠—now securely I take wing.’</p>
			<p>LXVIII</p>
			<p>Then Elfinan swift vaulted from the floor, And lighted graceful on the window-sill; Under one arm the magic book he bore, The other he could wave about at will; Pale was his face, he stiil look’d very ill: He bow’d at Bellanaine, and said⁠—‘ Poor Bell! Farewell! farewell! and if for ever ! still For ever fare thee well !’⁠—and then he fell A laughing !⁠—snapp’d his fingers !⁠—shame it is to tell!</p>
			<p>LXIX</p>
			<p>‘ By ‘r Lady ! he is gone!’ cries Hum, ‘ and I⁠—(I own it)⁠—have made too free with his wine ; Old Crafticant will smoke me. By-the-bye 1 This room is full of jewels as a mine⁠—Dear valuable creatures, how ye shine ! Sometime to-day I must contrive a minute, If Mercury propitiously incline. To examine his scrutoire, and see what’s in it. For of superfluous diamonds I as well may thin it.</p>
			<p>‘ The Emperor’s horrid bad ; yes, that’s my cue!’ Some histories say that this was Hum’s last speech;</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-404"/>
			<p>That, being fuddled, he went reeling through The corridor, and scarce upright could reach The stair-head ; that being glutted as a leech, And used, as we ourselves have just now said, To manage stairs reversely, like a peach Too ripe, he fell, being puzzled in his head With liquor and the staircase : verdict⁠—found stone dead.</p>
			<p>This, as a falsehood, Crafticanto treats ; And as his style is of strange elegance, Gentle and tender, full of soft conceits, (Much like our Boswell’s,) we will take a glance At his sweet prose, and, if we can, make dance His woven periods into careless rhyme; O, little faery Pegasus ! rear⁠—prance⁠—Trot round the quarto⁠—ordinary time ! March, little Pegasus, with pawing hoof sublime !</p>
			<p>LXXII</p>
			<p>‘ Well, let us see⁠—tentti hook and chapter nine, ‘⁠—Thus Crafticant pursues his diary :⁠—‘ ‘T was twelve o’clock at night, the weather fine. Latitude thirty-six ; our scouts descry A flight of starlings making rapidly Towards Thibet. Mem.:⁠—birds fly in the night; From twelve to half-past⁠—wings not fit to fly For a thick fog⁠—the Princess sulky quite : Caird for an extra shawl, and gave her nurse a bite.</p>
			<p>‘ Five minutes before one⁠—brought down a moth With my new double-barrel⁠—stew’d the thighs. And made a very tolerable broth⁠—Princess turn’d dainty, to our great surprise, Alter’d her mind, and thought it very nice : Seeing her pleasant, tried her with a pun,</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-405"/>
			<p>She frown’d ; a monstrous owl across us flies About this time⁠—a sad old figure of fun; Bad omen⁠—this new match can’t be a happy one.</p>
			<p>* From two to half-past, dusky way we made, Above the plains of Gobi⁠—desert, bleak; Beheld afar off, in the hooded shade Of darkness, a great mountain (strange to speak), Spitting, from forth its sulphur-baken peak, A fan-shaped burst of blood-red, arrowy fire, Turban’d with smoke, which still away did reek. Solid and black from that eternal pyre. Upon the laden winds that scantly could respire,</p>
			<p>LXXV</p>
			<p>‘Just upon three o’clock, a falling star</p>
			<p>Created an alarm among our troop,</p>
			<p>Kill’d a man-cook, a page, and broke a jar,</p>
			<p>A tureen, and three dishes, at one swoop.</p>
			<p>Then passing by the Princess, singed her hoop :</p>
			<p>Could not conceive what Coralline was at.</p>
			<p>She clapp’d her hands three times, and cried out</p>
			<p>“Whoop !” Some strange Imaian custom. A large bat Came sudden ‘fore my face, and brush’d against my hat.</p>
			<p>* Five minutes thirteen seconds after three, Far in the west a mighty fire broke out, Conjectured, on the instant, it might be The city of Balk⁠—’twas Balk beyond all doubt : A griffin, wheeling here and there about. Kept reconnoitering us⁠—doubled our guard⁠—Lighted our torches, and kept up a shout, Till he sheer’d off⁠—the Princess very scared⁠—And many on their marrow-bones for death prepared.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-406"/>
			<p>LXXVII</p>
			<p>‘ At half-past three arose the cheerful moon⁠—Bivoiiack’d for four minutes on a cloud⁠—Where from the earth we heard a lively tune Of tambourines and pipes, severe and loud, While on a flowery lawn a brilliant crowd Cinque-parted danced, some half asleep reposed Beneath the green-faned cedars, some did shroud In silken tents, and ‘mid light fragrance dozed, Or on the open turf their soothed eyelids closed.</p>
			<p>‘Dropp’d my gold watch, and kill’d a kettledrum⁠—It went for apoplexy⁠—foolish folks !⁠—Left it to pay the piper⁠—a good sum⁠—(I ‘ve got a conscience, maugre people’s jokes,) To scrape a little favour ; ‘gan to coax Her Highness’ pug-dog⁠—got a sharp rebuff⁠—She wish’d a game at whist⁠—made three revokes⁠—Turn’d from myself, her partner, in a huff ; His Majesty will know her temper time enough.</p>
			<p>* She cried for chess⁠—I play’d a game with her Castled her king with such a vixen look, It bodes ill to his Majesty⁠—(refer To the second chapter of my fortieth book, And see what hoity-toity airs she took). At half-past four the morn essay’d to beam⁠—Saluted, as we pass’d, an early rook⁠—The Princess fell asleep, and, in her dream, Talk’d of one Master Hubert, deep in her esteem.</p>
			<p>‘ About this time⁠—making delightful way⁠—Shed a quill-feather from my larboard wing⁠—</p>
			<p>i</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-407"/>
			<p>Wish’d, trusted, hoped ‘t was no sign of decay⁠—Thank Heaven, I ‘m hearty yet!⁠—‘t was no such</p>
			<p>thing:⁠—At five the golden light began to spring, With fiery shudder through the bloomed east; At six we heard Panthea’s churches ring⁠—The city all his unhived swarms had cast, To watch our grand approach, and hail us as we</p>
			<p>pass’d.</p>
			<p>* As flowers turn their faces to the sam, So on our flight with hungry eyes they gaze. And, as we shaped our course, this, that way run, With mad-cap pleasure, or hand-clasp’d amaze : Sweet in the air a mild-toned music plays, And progresses through its own labyrinth ; Buds gather’d from the green spring’s middle-days, They scatter’d⁠—daisy, primrose, hyacinth⁠—Or round white columns wreathed from capital to plinth.</p>
			<p>‘ Onward we floated o’er the panting streets, That seem’d throughout with upheld faces paved ; Look where we will, our bird’s-eye vision meets Legions of holiday ; bright standards waved, And fluttering ensigns emulously craved Our minute’s glance ; a busy thunderous roar,</p>
			<p>I From square to square, among the buildings raved. As when the sea, at flow, gluts up once more</p>
			<p>The craggy hoUowness of a wild-reefed shore.</p>
			<p>* And ” Bellanaine for ever ! ” shouted they ! While that fair Princess, from her winged chair,</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-408"/>
			<p>Bow’d low with high demeanour, and, to pay Their new-blown loyalty with guerdon fair. Still emptied, at meet distance, here and there, A plenty horn of jewels. And here I (Who wish to give the devil her due) declare Against that ugly piece of calumny. Which calls them Highland pebble-stones not worth a fly.</p>
			<p>LXXXIV</p>
			<p>* Still “Bellanaine ! “they shouted, while we glide ‘Slant to a light Ionic portico,</p>
			<p>The city’s delicacy, and the pride Of our Imperial Basilic ; a row ,</p>
			<p>Of lords and ladies, on each hand, make show Submissive of knee-bent obeisance, All down the steps ; and, as we enter’d, lo! The strangest sight⁠—the most unlook’d-for chance⁠—All things turn’d topsy-turvy in a devil’s dance.</p>
			<p>LXXXV</p>
			<p>“Stead of his anxious Majesty and court At the open doors, with wide saluting eyes. Congees and scrape-graces of every sort, And all the smooth routine of gallantries. Was seen, to our immoderate surprise, A motley crowd thick gather’d in the hall, Lords, scullions, deputy-scullions, with wild cries Stunning the vestible from wall to wall. Where the Chief Justice on his knees and hands doth crawl.</p>
			<p>LXXXVI</p>
			<p>* Counts of the palace, and the state purveyor Of moth’s-down, to make soft the royal beds, The Common Council and my fool Lord Mayor Marching a-row, each other slipshod treads;</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-409"/>
			<p>Powder’d bag-wigs and ruffy-tuffy heads Of cinder wenches meet and soil each other ; Toe crush’d with heel ill-natured fighting breeds, Frill-rumpling elbows brew up many a bother, And fists in the short ribs keep up the yell and pother.</p>
			<p>‘ A Poet, mounted on the Court-Clown’s back, Rode to the Princess swift with spurring heels, And close into her face, with rhyming clack, Began a Prothalamion ;⁠—she reels, She falls, she faints ! ■⁠—while laughter peals Over her woman’s weakness. ” Where ! ” cried I, ” Where is his Majesty ? ” No person feels Inclined to answer; wherefore instantly I plunged into the crowd to find him or to die.</p>
			<p>‘ Jostling my way I gain’d the stairs, and ran To the first landing, where, incredible ! I met, far gone in liquor, that old man,</p>
			<p>That vile impostor Hum, ‘</p>
			<p>So far so well⁠—For we have proved the Mago never fell Down stairs on Crafticanto’s evidence ; And therefore duly shall proceed to tell,’ Plain in our own original mood and tense. The sequel of this day, though labour’t is immense!</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-410"/>
			<p>THE LAST SONNET</p>
			<p>Bright star, would I were steadfast as thou art !</p>
			<p>Not in lone splendour liung aloft the night, And watching, with eternal lids apart,</p>
			<p>Like Nature’s patient sleepless Eremite, The moving waters at their priestlike task</p>
			<p>Of pure ablution round earth’s human shores Or gazing on the new soft fallen mask</p>
			<p>Of snow upon the mountains and the moors: No⁠—yet still steadfast, still unchangeable,</p>
			<p>Pillow’d upon my fair love’s ripening breast, To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,</p>
			<p>Awake for ever in a sweet unrest. Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath. And so live ever⁠—or else swoon to death.</p>

			<p>SUPPLEMENTARY VERSE</p>
			<p>The collection which follows is not intended to be taken exactly as containing the leavings of Keats’s genius ; there are verses in the previous groups which might be placed here, if the intention was to make a marked division between his well-defined poetry and his experiments and mere scintillations ; doubtless, too, on any such principle it would be just to take back into the respectability of larger type some of the lines here included. But it seemed wise to put into a subordinate group the poet’s fragmentary and posthumous poems, and those which were plainly the mere playthings of his muse.</p>
			<p>I. HYPERION: A VISION</p>
			<p>[*An attempt at remodelling the fragment of Hyperion into the form of a vision.’]</p>
			<p>CANTO I</p>
			<p>Fanatics have their dreams, wherewith they weave</p>
			<p>A paradise for a sect; the savage, too,</p>
			<p>From forth the loftiest fashion of his sleep</p>
			<p>Guesses at heaven ; pity these have not</p>
			<p>Trao’dupon vellum or wild Indian leaf</p>
			<p>The shadows of melodious utterance.</p>
			<p>But bare of laurel they live, dream, and die ;</p>
			<p>For Poesy alone can tell her dreams⁠—</p>
			<p>With the fine spell of words alone can save</p>
			<p>Imagination from the sable chain lo</p>
			<p>And dumb enchantment. “Who alive can say,</p>
			<p>* Thou art no Poet⁠—may’st not tell thy dreams’ ?</p>
			<p>Since every man whose soul is not a clod</p>
			<p>Hath visions and would speak, if he had loved,</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-412"/>
			<p>And been well nurtured in his mother tongue. Whether the dream now purpos’d to rehearse Be poet’s or fanatic’s will be known When this warm scribe, my hand, is in the grave.</p>
			<p>Methought I stood where trees of every clime,</p>
			<p>Palm, myrtle, oak, and sycamore, and beech, 2c</p>
			<p>With plantane and spice-blossoms, made a screen.</p>
			<p>In neighbourhood of fountains (by the noise</p>
			<p>Soft-showering in mine ears), and (by the touch</p>
			<p>Of scent) not far from roses. Twining round</p>
			<p>I saw an arbour with a drooping roof</p>
			<p>Of trellis vines, and bells, and larger blooms,</p>
			<p>Like floral censers, swinging light in air ;</p>
			<p>Before its wreathed doorway, on a mound</p>
			<p>Of moss, was spread a feast of summer fruits,</p>
			<p>Which, nearer seen, seem’d refuse of a meal_ 30</p>
			<p>By angel tasted or our Mother Eve ;</p>
			<p>For empty shells were scatter’d on the grass,</p>
			<p>And grapestalks but half-bare, and remnants more</p>
			<p>Sweet-smelling, whose pure kinds I could not know.</p>
			<p>Still was more plenty than the fabled horn</p>
			<p>Thrice emptied could pour forth at banqueting,</p>
			<p>For Proserpine return’d to her own fields,</p>
			<p>Where the white heifers low. And appetite,</p>
			<p>More yearning than on earth I ever felt,</p>
			<p>Growing within, I ate deliciously⁠—4°</p>
			<p>And, after not long, thirsted ; for thereby</p>
			<p>Stood a cool vessel of transparent juice</p>
			<p>Sipp’d by the wander’d bee, the which I took,</p>
			<p>And pledging all the mortals of the world.</p>
			<p>And all the dead whose names are in our lips.</p>
			<p>Drank. That full draught is parent of my theme.</p>
			<p>No Asian poppy nor elixir fine</p>
			<p>Of the soon fading, jealous Caliphat,</p>
			<p>No poison gender’d in close monkish cell.</p>
			<p>To thin the scarlet conclave of old men, 50</p>
			<p>Could so have rapt unwilling life away.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-413"/>
			<p>Among the fragrant husks and berries crush’d</p>
			<p>Upon the grass, I struggled hard against</p>
			<p>The domineering potion, but in vain.</p>
			<p>The cloudy swoon came on, and down I sank,</p>
			<p>Like a Silenus on an antique vase.</p>
			<p>How long I slumber’d ‘t is a chance to guess.</p>
			<p>When sense of life return’d, I started up</p>
			<p>As if with wings, but the fair trees were gone,</p>
			<p>The mossy mound and arbour were no more : 60</p>
			<p>I look’d around upon the curved sides</p>
			<p>Of an old sanctuary, with roof august,</p>
			<p>Builded so high, it seem’d that filmed clouds</p>
			<p>Might spread beneath as o’er the stars of heaven.</p>
			<p>So old the place was, I remember’d none</p>
			<p>The like upon the earth : what I had seen</p>
			<p>Of grey cathedrals, buttress’d walls, rent towers.</p>
			<p>The superannuations of sunk realms.</p>
			<p>Or Nature’s rocks toil’d hard in waves and winds,</p>
			<p>Seem’d but the faulture of decrepit things 70</p>
			<p>To that eternal domed monument.</p>
			<p>Upon the marble at my feet there lay</p>
			<p>Store of strange vessels and large draperies,</p>
			<p>Which needs had been of dyed asbestos wove,</p>
			<p>Or in that place the moth could not corrupt,,</p>
			<p>So white the linen, so, in some, distinct</p>
			<p>Ran imageries from a sombre loom.</p>
			<p>All in a mingled heap confus’d there lay</p>
			<p>Robes, golden tongs, censer and chafing-dish,</p>
			<p>Girdles, and chains, and holy jewelries. 80</p>
			<p>Turning from these with awe, once more I raised My eyes to fathom the space every way : The embossed roof, the silent massy range Of columns north and south, ending in mist Of nothing ; then to eastward, where black gates Were shut against the sunrise evermore; Then to the west I look’d, and saw far off An image, huge of feature as a cloud.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-414"/>
			<p>At level of whose feet an altar slept,</p>
			<p>To be approach’d on either side by steps 90</p>
			<p>And marble balustrade, and patient travail</p>
			<p>To count with toil the innumerable degrees.</p>
			<p>Toward the altar sober-pac’d I went,</p>
			<p>Repressing haste as too unholy there ;</p>
			<p>And, coming nearer, saw beside the shrine</p>
			<p>One ministering ; and there arose a flame</p>
			<p>When in mid-day the sickening east-wind</p>
			<p>Shifts sudden to the south, the small warm rain</p>
			<p>Melts out the frozen incense from all flowers.</p>
			<p>And fills the air with so much pleasant health 100</p>
			<p>That even the dying man forgets his shroud ;⁠—</p>
			<p>Even so that lofty sacrificial fire,</p>
			<p>Sending forth Maian incense, spread around</p>
			<p>Forgetfulness of everything but bliss,</p>
			<p>And clouded all the altar with soft smoke ;</p>
			<p>From whose white fragrant curtains thus I heard</p>
			<p>Language pronounc’d : ‘ If thou canst not ascend</p>
			<p>These steps, die on that marble where thou art.</p>
			<p>Thy flesh, near cousin to the common dust,</p>
			<p>Will parch for lack of nutriment; thy bones no</p>
			<p>Will wither in few years, and vanish so</p>
			<p>That not the quickest eye could find a grain</p>
			<p>Of what thou now art on that pavement cold.</p>
			<p>The sands of thy short life are spent this hour,</p>
			<p>And no hand in the universe can turn</p>
			<p>Thy hourglass, if these gummed leaves be burnt</p>
			<p>Ere thou canst mount up these immortal steps.’</p>
			<p>I heard, I look’d : two senses both at once,</p>
			<p>So fine, so subtle, felt the tyranny</p>
			<p>Of that fierce threat and the hard task proposed. 120</p>
			<p>Prodigious seem’d the toil; the leaves were yet</p>
			<p>Burning, when suddenly a palsied chill</p>
			<p>Struck from the paved level up my limbs,</p>
			<p>And was ascending quick to put cold grasp</p>
			<p>Upon those streams that pulse beside the throat.</p>
			<p>I shriek’d, and the sharp anguish of my shriek</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-415"/>
			<p>Stung my own ears; I strove hard to escape</p>
			<p>The numbness, strove to gain the lowest step.</p>
			<p>Slow, heavy, deadly was my pace : the cold</p>
			<p>Grew stifling, suffocating at the heart; 130</p>
			<p>And when I clasp’d my hands I felt them not.</p>
			<p>One minute before death my ic’d foot touch’d</p>
			<p>The lowest stair ; and, as it touch’d, life seem’d</p>
			<p>To pour in at the toes, I mounted up</p>
			<p>As once fair angels on a ladder flew</p>
			<p>From the green turf to heaven. ‘ Holy Power,’</p>
			<p>Cried I, approaching near the horned shrine,</p>
			<p>* What am I that should so be saved from death ?</p>
			<p>“What am I that another death come not</p>
			<p>To choke my utterance, sacrilegious, here ?’ 140</p>
			<p>Then said the veiled shadow : ‘ Thou hast felt</p>
			<p>What’t is to die and live again before</p>
			<p>Thy fated hour ; that thou hadst power to do so</p>
			<p>Is thine own safety ; thou hast dated on</p>
			<p>Thy doom.’ ‘ High Prophetess,’ said I, ‘ purge off</p>
			<p>Benign, if so it please thee, my mind’s film.’</p>
			<p>‘ None can usurp this height,’ return’d that shade,</p>
			<p>‘ But those to whom the miseries of the world</p>
			<p>Are misery, and will not let them rest.</p>
			<p>All else who find a haven in the world, 150</p>
			<p>Where they may thoughtless sleep away their days,</p>
			<p>If by a chance into this fane they come,</p>
			<p>Rot on the pavement where thou rottedst half.</p>
			<p>‘ Are there not thousands in the world,’ said I,</p>
			<p>Encourag’d by the sooth voice of the shade,</p>
			<p>‘ Who love their fellows even to the death,</p>
			<p>Who feel the giant agony of the world,</p>
			<p>And more, like slaves to poor humanity,</p>
			<p>Labour for mortal good ? I sure should see</p>
			<p>Other men here, but I am here alone.’ i6o</p>
			<p>‘ Those whom thou spakest of are no visionaries,’</p>
			<p>Rejoin’d that voice ; ‘they are no dreamers weak;</p>
			<p>They seek no wonder but the human face,</p>
			<p>No music but a happy-noted voice :</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-416"/>
			<p>They come not here, they have no thought to come;</p>
			<p>And thou art here, for thou art less than they.</p>
			<p>What benefit canst thou do, or all thy tribe,</p>
			<p>To the great world ? Thou art a dreaming thing,</p>
			<p>A fever of thyself: think of the earth ;</p>
			<p>What bliss, even in hope, is there for thee ? , 170</p>
			<p>What haven ? every creature hath its home,</p>
			<p>Every sole man hath days of joy and pain,</p>
			<p>Whether his labours be sublime or low⁠—</p>
			<p>The pain alone, the joy alone, distinct:</p>
			<p>Only the dreamer venoms all his days.</p>
			<p>Bearing more woe than all his sins deserve.</p>
			<p>Tkerefore, that happiness be somewhat shared,</p>
			<p>Such things as thou art are admitted oft</p>
			<p>Into like gardens thou didst pass erewhile.</p>
			<p>And suffer’d in these temples: for that cause 180</p>
			<p>Thou standestsafe beneath this statue’s knees.’</p>
			<p>‘ That I am favour’d for unworthiness. By such propitious parley medicined In sickness not ignoble, I rejoice. Aye, and could weep for love of such award.’ So answer’d I, continuing, ‘ If it please. Majestic shadow, tell me where I am. Whose altar this, for whom this incense curls ; What image this whose face I cannot see For the broad marble knees; and who thou art, 190 Of accent feminine so courteous ?’</p>
			<p>Then the tall shade, in drooping linen veil’d. Spoke out, so much more earnest, that her breath Stirr’d the thin folds of gauze that drooping hung About a golden censer from her hand Pendent; and by her voice I knew she shed Long-treasured tears. ‘ This temple, sad and lone. Is all spar’d from the thunder of a war Foughten long since by giant hierarchy Against rebellion : this old image here, 200</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-417"/>
			<p>“Whose carved features wrinkled as he fell,</p>
			<p>Is Saturn’s ; I, Moneta, left supreme,</p>
			<p>Sole goddess of this desolation.’</p>
			<p>I had no words to answer, for my tongue,</p>
			<p>Useless, could find about its roofed home</p>
			<p>No syllable of a fit majesty</p>
			<p>To make rejoinder to Moneta’s mourn :</p>
			<p>There was a silence, while the altar’s blaze</p>
			<p>Was fainting for sweet food. I look’d thereon,</p>
			<p>And on the paved floor, where nigh were piled 210</p>
			<p>Faggots of cinnamon, and many heaps</p>
			<p>Of other crisped spicewood : then again</p>
			<p>I look’d upon the altar, and its horns</p>
			<p>Whiten’d with ashes, and its languorous flame,</p>
			<p>And then upon the offerings again ;</p>
			<p>And so, by turns, till sad Moneta cried :</p>
			<p>* The sacrifice is done, but not the less</p>
			<p>Will I be kind to thee for thy good will.</p>
			<p>My power, which to me is still a curse,</p>
			<p>Shall be to thee a wonder ; for the scenes 220</p>
			<p>Still swooning vivid through my globed brain,</p>
			<p>With an electral changing misery.</p>
			<p>Thou shalt with these dull mortal eyes behold</p>
			<p>Free from all pain, if wonder pain thee not.’</p>
			<p>As near as an immortal’s sphered words</p>
			<p>Could to a mother’s soften were these last:</p>
			<p>And yet I had a terror of her robes.</p>
			<p>And chiefly of the veils that from her brow</p>
			<p>Hung pale, and curtain’d her in mysteries.</p>
			<p>That made my heart too small to hold its blood. 230</p>
			<p>This saw that Goddess, and with sacred hand</p>
			<p>Parted the veils. Then saw I a wan face,</p>
			<p>Not pin’d by human sorrows, but bright-blanch’d</p>
			<p>By an immortal sickness which kills not;</p>
			<p>It works a constant change, which happy death</p>
			<p>Can put no end to ; death wards progressing</p>
			<p>To no death was that visage ; it had past</p>
			<p>The lily and the snow ; and beyond these</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-418"/>
			<p>I must not think now, though I saw that face.</p>
			<p>But for her eyes I should have fled away; 240</p>
			<p>They held me back with a benignant light,</p>
			<p>Soft, mitigated by divinest lids</p>
			<p>Half-clos’d, and visionless entire they seem’d</p>
			<p>Of all external things ; they saw me not,</p>
			<p>But in blank splendour beam’d, like the mild moon,</p>
			<p>Who comforts those she sees not, who knows not</p>
			<p>What eyes are upward cast. As I had found</p>
			<p>A grain of gold upon a mountain’s side,</p>
			<p>And, twing’d with avarice, strain’d out my eyes</p>
			<p>To search its sullen entrails rich with ore, 250</p>
			<p>So, at the view of sad Moneta’s brow,</p>
			<p>I ask’d to see what things the hollow brow</p>
			<p>Behind environ’d : what high tragedy</p>
			<p>In the dark secret chambers of her skull</p>
			<p>Was acting, that could give so dread a stress</p>
			<p>To her cold lips, and fill with such a light</p>
			<p>Her planetary eyes, and touch her voice</p>
			<p>With such a sorrow ? ‘ Shade of Memory J’</p>
			<p>Cried I, with act adorant at her feet,</p>
			<p>‘ By all the gloom hung round thy fallen house, 26c-</p>
			<p>By this last temple, by the golden age.</p>
			<p>By great Apollo, thy dear foster-child.</p>
			<p>And by thyself, forlorn divinity,</p>
			<p>The pale Omega of a wither’d race.</p>
			<p>Let me behold, according as thou saidst,</p>
			<p>What in thy brain so ferments to and fro !’</p>
			<p>No sooner had this conjuration past</p>
			<p>My devout lips, than side by side we stood</p>
			<p>(Like a stunt bramble by a solemn pine)</p>
			<p>Deep in the shady sadness of a vale 270</p>
			<p>Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn,</p>
			<p>Far from the fiery noon and eve’s one star.</p>
			<p>Onward I look’d beneath the gloomy boughs,</p>
			<p>And saw what first I thought an image huge.</p>
			<p>Like to the image pedestall’d so high</p>
			<p>In Saturn’s temple; then Moneta’s voice</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-419"/>
			<p>Came brief upon mine ear. ‘ So Saturn sat</p>
			<p>When he had lost his reahns ;’ whereon there grew</p>
			<p>A power within me of enormous ken</p>
			<p>To see as a god sees, and take the depth 280</p>
			<p>Of things as nimbly as the outward eye</p>
			<p>Can size and shape pervade. The lofty theme</p>
			<p>Of those few words hung vast before my mind</p>
			<p>With half-unraveird web. I sat myself</p>
			<p>Upon an eagle’s watch, that I might see,</p>
			<p>And seeing ne’er forget. No stir of life</p>
			<p>Was in this shrouded vale⁠—not so much air</p>
			<p>As in the zoning of a summer’s day</p>
			<p>Robs not one light seed from the feather’d grass</p>
			<p>But where the dead leaf fell there did it rest. 290</p>
			<p>A stream went noiseless by, still deaden’d more</p>
			<p>By reason of the fallen divinity</p>
			<p>Spreading more shade; the Naiad ‘mid her reeds</p>
			<p>Prest her cold finger closer to her lips.</p>
			<p>Along the margin-sand large foot-marks went No further than to where old Saturn’s feet Had rested, and there slept how long a sleep ! Degraded, cold, upon the sodden ground His old right hand lay nerveless, listless, dead, Unsceptred, and his realmless eyes were closed ; 300 While his bowed head seem’d listening to the Earth, His ancient mother, for some comfort yet.</p>
			<p>It seem’d no force could wake him from his place; But there came one who, with a kindred hand, Touch’d his wide shoulders, after bending low With reverence, though to one who knew it not. Then came the grieved voice Mnemosyne, And griev’d I hearken’d. ‘ That divinity Whom thou saw’st step from yon forlornest wood, And with slow pace approach our fallen king, 310 Is Thea, softest-natured of our brood.’ I mark’d the Goddess, in fair statuary</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-420"/>
			<p>Surpassing wan Moneta by the head,</p>
			<p>And in her sorrow nearer woman’s tears.</p>
			<p>There was a list’ning fear in her regard,</p>
			<p>As if calamity had but begun ;</p>
			<p>As if the venom’d cloud of evil days</p>
			<p>Had spent their malice, and the sullen rear</p>
			<p>Was with its stored thunder labouring up.</p>
			<p>One hand she press’d upon that aching spot 320</p>
			<p>Where beats the human heart, as if just there,</p>
			<p>Though an immortal, she felt cruel pain ;</p>
			<p>The other upon Saturn’s bended neck</p>
			<p>She laid, and to the level of his ear</p>
			<p>Leaning, with parted lips some words she spoke</p>
			<p>In solemn tenour and deep organ-tone ;</p>
			<p>Some mourning words, which in our feeble tongue</p>
			<p>Would come in this like accenting ; how frail</p>
			<p>To that large utterance of the early gods !</p>
			<p>* Saturn, look up ! and for what, poor lost king ? I have no comfort for thee ; no, not one ; 331</p>
			<p>I cannot say, wherefore thus sleepest thou ? For Heaven is parted from thee, and the Earth Knows thee not, so aMcted, for a god. •</p>
			<p>The Ocean, too, with all its solemn noise. Has from thy sceptre pass’d ; and all the air Is emptied of thy hoary majesty. f</p>
			<p>Thy thunder, captious at the new command, Rumbles reluctant o’er our fallen house ; And thy sharp lightning, in unpractis’d hands, 340 Scourges and burns our once serene domain.</p>
			<p>‘With such remorseless speed still come new woes, That unbelief has not a space to breathe. Saturn ! sleep on : me thoughtless, why should I Thus violate thy slumbrous solitude ? Why should I ope thy melancholy eyes ? • Saturn ! sleep on, while at thy feet I weep.’</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-421"/>
			<p>As when upon a tranced summer-night Forests, branch-charmed by the earnest stars, Dream, and so dream all night without a noise, 350 Save from one gradual solitary gust Swelling upon the silence, dying off, As if the ebbing air had but one wave, So came these words and went; the while in tears She prest her fair large forehead to the earth, Just where her fallen hair might spread in curls, A soft and silken net for Saturn’s feet. Long, long these two were postured motionless. Like sculpture builded-up upon the grave Of their own power. A long awful time 360</p>
			<p>I look’d upon them: still they were the same ; The frozen God still bending to the earth, And the sad Goddess weeping at his feet; Moneta silent. Without stay or prop But my own weak mortality, I bore The load of this eternal quietude. The unchanging gloom and the three fixed shapes Ponderous upon my senses, a whole moon ; For by my burning brain I measiu-ed sure Her silver seasons shedded on the night, 370</p>
			<p>And every day by day methought I grew More gaunt and ghostly. Oftentimes I pray’d Intense, that death would take me from the vale And all its burthens ; gasping with despair Of change, hour after hour I curs’d myself, Until old Saturn rais’d his faded eyes. And look’d around and saw his kingdom gone, And all the gloom and sorrow of the place, And that fair kneeling Goddess at his feet.</p>
			<p>As the moist scent of flowers, and grass, and leaves 380</p>
			<p>Fills forest-dells with a pervading air. Known to the woodland nostril, so the words Of Saturn fill’d the mossy glooms around,</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-422"/>
			<p>Even to the hollows of time-eaten oaks, And to the windings of the foxes’ hole, With sad, low tones, while thus he spoke, and sent Strange moanings to the solitary Pan. * Moan, brethren, moan, for we are swallow’d up And buried from all godlike exercise Of influence benign on planets pale, 390</p>
			<p>And peaceful sway upon man’s harvesting, And all those acts which Deity supreme Doth ease its heart of love in. Moan and wail; Moan, brethren, moan; for lo, the rebel spheres Spin round ; the stars their ancient courses keep ; Clouds still with shadowy moisture haunt the earth, Still suck their fill of light from sun and moon ; Still buds the tree, and still the seashores murmur; There is no death in all the universe, No smell of death. — There shall be death. Moan, moan; 400</p>
			<p>Moan, Cybele, moan ; for thy pernicious babes Have chang’d a god into an aching palsy. Moan, brethren, moan, for I have no strength left; Weak as the reed, weak, feeble as my voice. Oh! Oh! the pain, the pain of feebleness; Moan, moan, for still I thaw ; or give me help, Throw down those imps, and give me victory. Let me hear other groans, and trumpets blown Of triumph calm, and hymns of festival. From the gold peaks of heaven’s high-piled clouds; Voices of soft proclaim, and silver stir 411</p>
			<p>Of strings in hollow shells ; and there shall be Beautiful things made new, for the surprise Of the sky-children.’ So he feebly ceased. With such a poor and sickly-sounding pause, Methought I heard some old man of the earth Bewailing earthly loss; nor could my eyes And ears act with that unison of sense Which marries sweet sound with the grace of form, And dolorous accent from a tragic harp 420</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-423"/>
			<p>With large limb’d visions. More I scrutinized.</p>
			<p>Still fixt he sat beneath the sable trees,</p>
			<p>“Whose arms spread straggling in wild serpent forms,</p>
			<p>With leaves all hush’d ; his awful presence there</p>
			<p>(Now all was silent) gave a deadly lie</p>
			<p>To what I ere while heard : only his lips</p>
			<p>Trembled amid the white curls of his beard;</p>
			<p>They told the truth, though round the snowy locks</p>
			<p>Hung nobly, as upon the face of heaven</p>
			<p>A mid-day fleece of clouds. Thea arose 430</p>
			<p>And stretcht her white arm through the hollow dark.</p>
			<p>Pointing somewhither : whereat he too rose,</p>
			<p>Like a vast giant, seen by men at sea</p>
			<p>To grow pale from the waves at dull midnight.</p>
			<p>They melted from my sight into the woods;</p>
			<p>Ere I could turn, Moneta cried, ‘ These twain</p>
			<p>Are speeding to the families of grief.</p>
			<p>Where, rooft in by black rocks, they waste in pain</p>
			<p>And darkness, for no hope.’ And she spake on.</p>
			<p>As ye may read who can unwearied pass 440</p>
			<p>Onward from the antechamber of this dream,</p>
			<p>Where, even at the open doors, awhile</p>
			<p>I must delay, and glean my memory</p>
			<p>Of her high phrase⁠—perhaps no further dare.</p>
			<p>CANTO II</p>
			<p>* Mortal, that thou may’st understand aright, I humanize my sayings to thine ear, Making comparisons of earthly things ; Or thou might’st better listen to the wind. Whose language is to thee a barren noise, Though it blows legend-laden thro’ the trees. In melancholy realms big tears are shed, More sorrow like to this, and such like woe, Too huge for mortal tongue or pen of scribe. The Titans fierce, self-hid or prison-bound, 10</p>
			<p>Groan for the old allegiance once more,</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-424"/>
			<p>Listening in their doom for Saturn’s voice.</p>
			<p>But one of the whole eagle-brood still keeps</p>
			<p>His sovereignty, and rule, and majesty :</p>
			<p>Blazing Hyperion on his orbed fire</p>
			<p>Still sits, still snuffs the incense teeming up</p>
			<p>From Man to the Sun’s God⁠—yet insecure.</p>
			<p>For as upon the earth dire prodigies</p>
			<p>Fright and perplex, so also shudders he ;</p>
			<p>Not at dog’s howl or gloom-bird’s hated screech, 20</p>
			<p>Or the familiar visiting of one</p>
			<p>Upon the first toll of his passing bell,</p>
			<p>Or prophesyings of the midnight lamp;</p>
			<p>But horrors, portioned to a giant nerve.</p>
			<p>Make great Hyperion ache. His palace bright,</p>
			<p>Bastion’d with pyramids of shining gold.</p>
			<p>And touch’d with shade of bronzed obelisks,</p>
			<p>Glares a blood-red thro’ all the thousand courts,</p>
			<p>Arches, and domes, and fiery galleries ;</p>
			<p>And all its curtains of Aurorian clouds 30</p>
			<p>Flash angerly ; when he would taste the wreaths</p>
			<p>Of incense breath’d aloft from sacred hills.</p>
			<p>Instead of sweets, his ample palate takes</p>
			<p>Savour of poisonous brass and metals sick;</p>
			<p>Wherefore when harbour’d in the sleepy “West,</p>
			<p>After the full completion of fair day.</p>
			<p>For rest divine upon exalted couch.</p>
			<p>And slumber in the arms of melody,</p>
			<p>He paces through the pleasant hours of ease,</p>
			<p>With strides colossal, on from hall to hall, 40</p>
			<p>While far within each aisle and deep recess</p>
			<p>His winged minions in close clusters stand</p>
			<p>Amaz’d, and full of fear ; like anxious men,</p>
			<p>Who on a wide plain gather in sad troops.</p>
			<p>When earthquakes jar their battlements and towers.</p>
			<p>Even now where Saturn, rous’d from icy trance,</p>
			<p>Goes step for step with Thea from yon woods,</p>
			<p>Hyperion, leaving twilight in the rear.</p>
			<p>Is sloping to the threshold of the West.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-425"/>
			<p>Thither we tend.’ Now in clear light I stood, 50</p>
			<p>Reliev’d from the dusk vale. Mnemosyne</p>
			<p>Was sitting on a sqiiare-edg’d polish’d stone,</p>
			<p>That in its lucid depths reflected pure</p>
			<p>Her priestess’ garments. My quick eyes ran on</p>
			<p>From stately nave to nave, from vault to vault,</p>
			<p>Through bow’rs of fragrant and enwreathed light,</p>
			<p>And diamond-paved lustrous long arcades.</p>
			<p>Anon rush’d by the bright Hyperion ;</p>
			<p>His flaming robes stream’d out beyond his heels,</p>
			<p>And gave a roar as if of earthly fire, 6c</p>
			<p>That scar’d away the meek ethereal hours,</p>
			<p>And made their dove-wings tremble. On he flared.</p>

			<div class="newpage" id="page-426"/>
			<p>A thing of soft misnomers, so divine</p>

			<p>FRAGMENT OF ‘THE CASTLE BUILDER’</p>
			<p>To-night I’ 11 have my friar⁠—let me think</p>
			<p>About my room⁠—I ’11 have it in the pink ;</p>
			<p>It should be rich and sombre, and the moon,</p>
			<p>Just in its mid-life in the midst of June</p>
			<p>Should look thro’ four large windows and display</p>
			<p>Clear, but for gold-fish vases in the way.</p>
			<p>Their glassy diamonding on Turkish floor ;</p>
			<p>The tapers keep aside, an hour and more,</p>
			<p>To see what else the moon alone can show ;</p>
			<p>While the night-breeze doth softly let us know</p>
			<p>My terrace is well bower’d with oranges.</p>
			<p>Upon the floor the dullest spirit sees</p>
			<p>A guitar-ribband and a lady’s glove</p>
			<p>Beside a crumple-leaved tale of love ;</p>
			<p>A tambour-frame, with Venus sleeping there,</p>
			<p>All finish’d but some ringlets of her hair ;</p>
			<p>A viol, bow-strings torn, cross-wise upon</p>
			<p>A glorious folio of Anacreon;</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-427"/>
			<p>A skull upon a mat of roses lying,</p>
			<p>Ink’d purple with a song concerning dying;</p>
			<p>An hour-glass on the turn, amid the trails</p>
			<p>Of passion-flower;⁠—just in time there sails</p>
			<p>A cloud across the moon⁠—the lights bring in I</p>
			<p>And see what more my phantasy can win.</p>
			<p>It is a gorgeous room, but somewhat sad ;</p>
			<p>The draperies are so, as tho’ they had</p>
			<p>Been made for Cleopatra’s winding-sheet;</p>
			<p>And opposite the stedfast eye doth meet</p>
			<p>A spacious looking-glass, upon whose face,</p>
			<p>In letters raven-sombre, you may trace</p>
			<p>Old ‘Mene, Mene, Tekel Upharsin.’</p>
			<p>Greek busts and statuary have ever been</p>
			<p>Held, by the finest spirits, fitter far.</p>
			<p>Than vase grotesque and Siamesian jar ;</p>

			<p>My table-co verlits of Jason’s fleece</p>

			<p>After some beauty veiled far away,</p>
			<p>Eacli step he took should make his lady’s hand</p>
			<p>More soft, more white, and her fair cheek more fair:</p>

			<p>DAISY’S SONG</p>
			<p>The sun, with his great eye, Sees not so much as I; And the moon, all silver-proud, Might as well be in a cloud.</p>
			<p>And O the spring⁠—the spring ! I lead the life of a King ! Couch’d in the teeming grass, I spy each pretty lass.</p>
			<p>I look where no one dares. And I stare where no one stares, And when the night is nigh. Lambs bleat my lullaby.</p>

			<p>Oh, I am frighten’d with most hateful thoughts! Perhaps her voice is not a nightingale’s. Perhaps her teeth are not the fairest pearl; Her eye-lashes may be, for aught I know, Not longer than the May-fly’s small fanhorns; There may not be one dimple on her hand ; And freckles many; ah ! a careless nurse, In haste to teach the little thing to walk. May have crumpt up a pair of Dian’s legs, And warpt the ivory of a Juno’s neck.</p>
			<p>SONG</p>
			<p>The stranger lighted from his steed. And ere he spake a word,</p>
			<p>He seiz’d my lady’s lily hand. And kiss’d it all unheard.</p>
			<p>The stranger walk’d into the hall, And ere he spake a word.</p>
			<p>He kiss’d my lady’s cherry lips, And kiss’d ’em all unheard.</p>
			<p>The stranger walk’d into the bower, But my lady first did go⁠—</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-430"/>
			<p>Ay hand in hand into the bower, Where my Lord’s roses blow.</p>
			<p>My lady’s maid had a silken scarf,</p>
			<p>And a golden ring had she, And a kiss from the stranger, as off he went</p>
			<p>Again on his palfr’ey.</p>
			<p>Asleep ! O sleep a little while, white pearl And let me kneel, and let me pray to thee, And let me call Heaven’s blessing on thine eyes, And let me breathe into the happy air, That doth enfold and touch thee all about, Vows or my slavery, my giving up. My sudden adoration, my great love 1</p>
			<p>IIL FAMILIAR VERSES STANZAS TO MISS WYLIE</p>
			<p>O COME, Georgiana ! the rose is full blown. The riches of Flora are lavishly strown, The air is all softness, and crystal the streams; The West is resplendently clothed in beams.</p>
			<p>O come ! let us haste to the freshening shades, The quaintly carv’d seats, and the opening glades; Where the faeries are chanting their evening hymns. And the last sun-beam the sylph lightly swims.</p>
			<p>And when thou art weary, I ’11 find thee a bed Of mosses and flowers to pillow thy head : And there Georgiana I ’11 sit at thy feet. While my story of love I enraptur’d repeat.</p>
			<p>So fondly I ’11 breathe, and so softly I ’11 sigh, Thou wilt think that some amorous zephyr is nigh ;</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-431"/>
			<p>Yet no⁠—as I breathe I will press thy fair knee, And then thou wilt know that the sigh comes from me.</p>
			<p>Ah! why, dearest girl, should we lose all these blisses? That mortal’s a fool who such happiness misses : So smile acquiescence, and give me thy hand, With love-looking eyes, and with voice sweetly bland.</p>
			<p>EPISTLE TO JOHN HAMILTON REYNOLDS</p>
			<p>Dear Reynolds ! As last night I lay in bed, There came before my eyes that wonted thread Of shapes, and shadows, and remembrances. That every other minute vex and please : Things all disjointed come from north and south⁠—Two Witch’s eyes above a Cherub’s mouth, Voltaire with casque and shield and habergeon, And Alexander with his nightcap on ; Old Socrates a-tying his cravat. And Hazlitt playing with Miss Edgeworth’s cat; i And Junius Brutus, pretty well so so, Making the best of ‘s way towards Soho.</p>
			<p>Few are there who escape these visitings⁠—Perhaps one or two whose lives have patent wings, And thro’ whose curtains peeps no hellish nose, No wild-boar tushes, and no Mermaid’s toes ; But flowers bursting out with lusty pride, And young ^olian harps personify’d ; Some Titian colours touch’d into real life⁠—The sacrifice goes on ; the pontiff knife 2.</p>
			<p>Gleams in the Sun, the milk-white heifer lows, The pipes go shrilly, the libation flows: A white sail shows above the green-head cliff, Moves round the point, and throws her anchor stiff The mariners join hymn with those on land.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-432"/>
			<p>You know the Enchanted Castle⁠—it doth stand Upon a rock, on the border of a Lake, Nested in trees, which all do seem to shake From some old magic-like Urganda’s sword. O Phoebus ! that I had thy sacred word 30</p>
			<p>To show this Castle, in fair dreaming wise,: Unto my friend, while sick and ill he lies !</p>
			<p>You know it well enough, where it doth seem A mossy place, a Merlin’s Hall, a dream ; You know the clear Lake, and the little Isles, The mountains blue, and cold near neighbour rills, All which elsewhere are but half animate ; There do they look alive to love and hate, To smiles and frowns ; they seem a lifted mound Above some giant, pulsing underground. 40</p>
			<p>Part of the building was a chosen See, Built by a banish’d Santon of Chaldee ; The other part, two thousand years from him, “Was built by Cuthbert de Saint Aldebrim ; Then there ‘s a little wing, far from the Sun, Built by a Lapland Witch turn’d maudlin Nun; And many other juts of aged stone Founded with many a mason-devil’s groan.</p>
			<p>The doors all look as if they op’d themselves: The windows as if latch’d by Fays and Elves, 50 And from them comes a silver flash of light, As from the westward of a Summer’s night; Or like a beauteous woman’s large blue eyesj Gone mad through olden songs and poesies.</p>
			<p>See ! what is coming from the distance dim ! j</p>
			<p>A golden Galley all in silken trim ! *</p>
			<p>Three rows of oars are lightning, moment whiles Into the verd’rous bosoms of those isles; Towards the shade, under the Castle wall, It comes in silence⁠—now ‘t is hidden all. 60</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-433"/>
			<p>The Clarion sounds, and from a Postern-gate An echo of sweet music doth create A fear in the poor Herdsman who doth bring His beasts to trouble the enchanted spring⁠—He tells of the sweet music, and the spot, To all his friends, and they believe him not.</p>
			<p>O that our dreamings all, of sleep or wake, Would all their colours from the sunset take: From something of material sublime. Rather than shadow our own soul’s day-time 70</p>
			<p>In the dark void of night. For in the world We jostle⁠—but my flag is not unfurl’d On the Admiral-staff⁠—and so philosophise I dare not yet ! O, never will the prize, High reason, and the love of good and ill, Be my award ! Things cannot to the will Be settled, but they tease us out of thought; Or is it imagination brought Beyond its proper bound, yet still confin’d, Lost in a sort of Purgatory blind, 80</p>
			<p>Cannot refer to any standard law Of either earth or heaven ? It is a flaw In happiness, to see beyond our bourn. — It forces us in summer skies to mourn. It spoils the singing of the Nightingale.</p>
			<p>Dear Reynolds ! I have a mysterious tale, And cannot speak it: the first page I read Upon a Lampit rock of green sea-weed Among the breakers ; ‘t was a quiet eve, The rocks were silent, the wide sea did weave 90 An untumultuous fringe of silver foam Along the flat brown sand ; I was at home And should have been most happy⁠—but I saw Too far into the sea, where every maw The greater on the less feeds evermore. — But I saw too distinct into the core</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-434"/>
			<p>Of an eternal fierce destruction,</p>
			<p>And so from happiness I far was gone.</p>
			<p>Still am I sick of it, and tho’ to-day,</p>
			<p>I ‘ve gather’d young spring-leaves, and flowers gay</p>
			<p>Of periwinkle and wild straw^berry, loi</p>
			<p>Still do I that most fierce destruction see,</p>
			<p>The Shark at savage prey⁠—the Hawk at</p>
			<p>pounce⁠—The gentle Robin, like a Pard or Ounce, Ravening a worm⁠—Away, ye horrid moods ! Moods of one’s mind ! You know I hate them well. You know I ‘d sooner be a clapping Bell To some Kamschatkan Missionary Church, Than with these horrid moods be left i’ the lurch.</p>
			<p>A DRAUGHT OF SUNSHINE</p>
			<p>Hence Burgundy, Claret, and Port,</p>
			<p>Away with old Hock and Madeira, Too earthly ye are for my sport;</p>
			<p>There’s a beverage brighter and clearer. Instead of a pitiful rummer, My wine overbrims a whole summer;</p>
			<p>My bowl is the sky.</p>
			<p>And I drink at my eye,</p>
			<p>Till I feel in the brain</p>
			<p>A Delphian pain⁠—Then follow, my Caius ! then follow :</p>
			<p>On the green of the hill</p>
			<p>We will drink our fill</p>
			<p>Of golden sunshine,</p>
			<p>Till our brains intertwine With the glory and grace of Apollo ! God of the Meridian,</p>
			<p>And of the East and West, To thee my soul is flown,</p>
			<p>And my body is earthward press’d. — It is an awful mission, A terrible division;</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-435"/>
			<p>And leaves a gulf austere To be fill’d with worldly fear. Aye, when the soul is fled To high above our head, Affrighted do we gaze After its airy maze, As doth a mother wild, When her young infant child Is in an eagle’s claws⁠—And is not this the cause Of madness ?⁠—God of Song, Thou bearest me along Through sights I scarce can bear : O let me, let me share With the hot lyre and thee. The staid Philosophy. Temper my lonely hours, And let me see thy bowers More unalarm’d !</p>
			<p>AT TEIGNMOUTH</p>
			<p>Here all the summer could I stay, For there’s Bishop’s teign And King’s teign</p>
			<p>And Coomb at the clear teign head-Where close by the stream You may have your cream</p>
			<p>All spread upon barley bread.</p>
			<p>There ‘s arch Brook</p>
			<p>And there’s larch Brook Both turning many a mill ;</p>
			<p>And cooling the drouth</p>
			<p>Of the salmon’s mouth And fattening his silver gill.</p>
			<p>There is Wild wood, A Mild hood</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-436"/>
			<p>To the sheep on the lea o’ the down,</p>
			<p>Where the golden furze</p>
			<p>With its green, thin spurs, Doth catch at the maiden’s gown.</p>
			<p>There is Newton marsh</p>
			<p>With its spear grass harsh⁠—A pleasant summer level</p>
			<p>Where the maidens sweet</p>
			<p>Of the Market Street, Do meet in the dusk to revel.</p>
			<p>There’s the Barton rich</p>
			<p>With dyke and ditch And hedge for the thrush to live in ;</p>
			<p>And the hollow tree</p>

			<p>MEG MERRILIES</p>
			<p>Old Meg she was a Gipsy,</p>
			<p>And liv’d upon the Moors: Her bed it was the brown heath turf,</p>
			<p>And her house was out of doors.</p>
			<p>Her apples were swart blackberries,</p>
			<p>Her currants pods o’ broom; Her wine was dew of the wild white rose,</p>
			<p>Her book a churchyard tomb.</p>
			<p>Her Brothers were the craggy hills,</p>

			<p>Full hard against the Moon.</p>
			<p>But every morn of woodbine fresh</p>
			<p>She made her garlanding, And every night the dark glen Yew</p>

			<p>And with her fingers old and brown</p>

			<p>TO THOMAS KEATS Belantbee (for Ballantree) July 10 [1818.]</p>
			<p>Ah ! ken ye what I met the day</p>
			<p>Out oure the Mountains A coming down by craggies gray</p>
			<p>An mossie fountains⁠—Ah goud-hair’d Marie yeve I pray</p>

			<p>A troup o’ Horses⁠—And as they trotted down the glen</p>
			<p>I sped to meet them To see if I might know the Men</p>
			<p>To stop and greet them. First Willie on his sleek mare came</p>
			<p>At canting gallop, His long hair rustled like a flame</p>
			<p>On board a shallop, Then came his brother Rab and then</p>

			<p>Twixt growth and waning⁠—She tiirn’d her dazed eyes full oft</p>
			<p>For there her Brithers Came riding with her Bridegroom soft</p>
			<p>And mony ithers. Young Tarn came up and eyed me quick</p>

			<p>LINES WRITTEN IN THE HIGHLANDS AFTER A VISIT TO BURNS’S COUNTRY</p>
			<p>There is a charm in footing slow across a silent</p>
			<p>plain, Where patriot battle has been fought, where glory-had the gain; There is a pleasure on the heath where Druids old</p>
			<p>have been, Where mantles gray have rustled by and swept the</p>
			<p>nettles green ; There is Joy in every spot made known by times of</p>
			<p>old, New to the feet, although each tale a hundred times</p>
			<p>be told; There is a deeper Joy than all, more solemn in the</p>
			<p>heart, More parching to the tongue than all, of more divine</p>
			<p>a smart, When weary steps forget themselves upon a pleasant</p>
			<p>turf, Upon hot sand, or flinty road, or sea-shore iron scurf, Toward the Castle or the Cot, where long ago was</p>
			<p>born II</p>
			<p>One who was great through mortal days, and died</p>
			<p>of fame unshorn. Light heather-bells may tremble then, but they are</p>
			<p>far away ; Wood-lark may sing from sandy fern⁠—the Sun</p>
			<p>may hear his Lay ; Runnels may kiss the grass on shelves and shallows</p>
			<p>clear. But their low voices are not heard, though come on</p>
			<p>travels drear ; Blood-red the s\m may set behind black mountain</p>
			<p>peaks ; Blue tides may sluice and drench their time in Caves</p>
			<p>and weedy creeks;</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-447"/>
			<p>Eagles may seem to sleep wing-wide upon the Air; Ring-doves may fly conviils’d across to some higli-</p>
			<p>cedar’d lair ; 20</p>
			<p>But the forgotten eye is still fast lidded to the</p>
			<p>ground, As Palmer’s, that with weariness, mid-desert shrine</p>
			<p>hath found.</p>
			<p>At such a time the soul’s a child, in childhood is</p>
			<p>the brain ; Forgotten is the worldly heart⁠—alone, it heats in</p>
			<p>vain. — Aye, if a Madman could have leave to pass a healthful day To tell his forehead’s swoon and faint when first</p>
			<p>began decay, He might make tremble many a one whose spirit had</p>
			<p>gone forth To find a Bard’s low cradle-place about the silent</p>
			<p>North. Scanty the hour and few the steps beyond the bourn</p>
			<p>of Care, Beyond the sweet and bitter world⁠—beyond it</p>
			<p>unaware! 30</p>
			<p>Scanty the hour and few the steps, because a longer</p>
			<p>stay Would bar return, and make a man forget his mortal</p>
			<p>way: O horrible! to lose the sight of well remember’d</p>
			<p>face, Of Brother’s eyes, of Sister’s brow⁠—constant to</p>
			<p>every place; Filling the Air, as on we move, with Portraiture</p>
			<p>intense; More warm than those heroic tints that pain a</p>
			<p>Painter’s sense. When shapes of old come striding by, and visages</p>
			<p>of old.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-448"/>
			<p>Locks shining black, liair scanty gray, and passions</p>
			<p>manifold. No, no, that horror cannot be, for at the cable’s</p>
			<p>length Man feels the gentle anchor pull and gladdens in its</p>
			<p>strength :⁠—40 “</p>
			<p>One hour, half-idiot, he stands by mossy water-fall. But in the very next he reads his soul’s Memorial:⁠—He reads it on the mountain’s height, where chance</p>
			<p>he may sit down Upon rough marble diadem⁠—that hill’s eternal</p>
			<p>Crown. Yet be his Anchor e’er so fast, room is there for a</p>
			<p>prayer That man may never lose his Mind on Mountains</p>
			<p>black and bare ; That he may stray league after league some great</p>
			<p>birthplace to find And keep his vision clear from speck, his inward</p>
			<p>sight unblind.</p>
			<p>MRS. CAMERON AND BEN NEVIS</p>
			<p>After all there was one Mrs. Cameron of 50 years of age and the fattest woman in all Inverness-shire who got up this Mountain some few years ago⁠—true she had her servants⁠—but then she had herself. She ought to have hired Sisyphus⁠—‘Up the high hill he heaves a huge round⁠—Mrs. Cameron.’ ‘T is said a little conversation took place between the mountain and the Lady. After taking a glass of Whisky as she was tolerably seated at ease she thus began⁠—</p>
			<p>MRS. C.</p>
			<p>Upon my life Sir Nevis I am piqued That I have so far panted tugg’d and reek’d To do an honor to your old bald pate And now am sitting on you j ust to bait, Without your paying me one compliment.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-449"/>
			<p>Alas, ‘t is so with all, when our intent Is plain, and in the eye of all Mankind We fair ones show a preference, too blind! You Gentle man immediately turn tail⁠—</p>
			<p>0 let me then my hapless fate bewail! lo Ungrateful Baldpate have I not disdain’d</p>
			<p>The pleasant Valleys⁠—have I not madbrain’d</p>
			<p>Deserted all my Pickles and preserves</p>
			<p>My China closet too⁠—with wretched Nerves</p>
			<p>To boot⁠—say, wretched ingrate, have I not</p>
			<p>Left my soft cushion chair and caudle pot ?</p>
			<p>‘T is true I had no corns⁠—no! thank the fates</p>
			<p>My Shoemaker was always Mr, Bates.</p>
			<p>And if not Mr. Bates why I ‘m not old!</p>
			<p>Still dumb ungrateful Nevis⁠—still so cold ! 20</p>
			<p>Here the Lady took some more whisky and was putting even more to her lips when she dashed it to the Ground, for the Moimtain began to grumble⁠—which continued for a few minutes before he thus began⁠—</p>
			<p>BEN NEVIS</p>
			<p>What whining bit of tongue and Mouth thus dares</p>
			<p>Disturb my slumber of a thousand years ?</p>
			<p>Even so long my sleep has been secure⁠—</p>
			<p>And to be so awak’d I ’11 not endure.</p>
			<p>Oh pain⁠—for since the Eagle’s earliest scream</p>
			<p>1 ‘ve had a damn’d confounded ugly dream,</p>
			<p>A Nightmare sure. What! Madam, was it you ? It cannot be ! My old eyes are not true 1 Red-Crag, my Spectacles ! Now let me see ! Good Heavens! Lady, how the gemini 30</p>
			<p>Did you get here ? O, I shall split my sides ! I shall earthquake⁠—</p>
			<p>Sweet Nevis do not quake, for though I love Your honest Countenance all things above.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-450"/>
			<p>Truly I should not like to be convey’d So far into your Bosom⁠—gentle Maid Loves not too rough a treatment, gentle Sir⁠—Pray thee be calm and do not quake nor stir No, not a Stone, or I shall go in fits⁠—</p>
			<p>BEN NEVIS</p>
			<p>I must⁠—I shall⁠—I meet not such tit bits⁠—40</p>
			<p>I meet not such sweet creatures every day⁠—By my old nightcap night and day I must have one sweet Buss⁠—I must and shall! Red Crag !⁠—What! Madam, can you then repent Of all the toil and vigour you have spent To see Ben Nevis and to touch his nose ? Red Crag I say ! O I must have them close! Red Crag, there lies beneath my farthest toe A vein of Sulphur⁠—go, dear Red Crag, go⁠—And rub your flinty back against it⁠—budge ! 50 Dear Madam, I must kiss you, faith I must! I must embrace you with my dearest gust! Block-head, d’ ye hear !⁠—Block-head, I ’11 make her</p>
			<p>feel. There lies beneath my east leg’s northern heel A cave of young earth dragons ;⁠—well my boy Go thither quick and so complete my joy. Take you a bundle of the largest pines. And when the sun on fiercest Phosphor shines, Fire them and ram them in the Dragon’s nest, Then will the dragons fry and fizz their best 60</p>
			<p>Until ten thousand now no bigger than Poor alligators⁠—poor things of one span⁠—Will each one swell to twice ten times the size Of northern whale⁠—then for the tender prize⁠—The moment then⁠—for then will Red Crag rub His flinty back⁠—and I shall kiss and snub And press my dainty morsel to my breast. Block-head make haste!</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-451"/>
			<p>O Muses, weep the rest⁠—The Lady fainted and he thought her dead; So pulled the clouds again about his head 70</p>
			<p>And went to sleep again; soon she was rous’d By her affrighted servants⁠—next day, hous’d Safe on the lowly ground she bless’d her fate That fainting fit was not delayed too late.</p>
			<p>But what surprised me above all is how the lady got down again. I felt it horribly. ‘T was the most vile descent⁠—shook me all to pieces.</p>
			<p>SHARING EVE’S APPLE</p>
			<p>O BLUSH not so ! O blush not so !</p>
			<p>Or I shall think you knowing ; And if you smile the blushing while,</p>
			<p>Then maidenheads are going.</p>
			<p>There’s a blush for won’t, and a blush for shan’t,</p>
			<p>And a blush for having done it : There’s a blush for thought and a blush for nought,</p>
			<p>And a blush for just begun it.</p>
			<p>O sigh not so! O sigh not so!</p>
			<p>For it sounds of Eve’s sweet Pippin ; By these loosen’d lips you have tasted the pips</p>
			<p>And fought in an amorous nipping.</p>
			<p>Will you play once more at nice-cut-core,</p>
			<p>For it only will last our youth out, And we have the prime of the kissing time,</p>
			<p>We have not one sweet tooth out.</p>
			<p>There’s a sigh for yes, and a sigh for no,</p>
			<p>And a sigh for I can’t bear it! O what can be done, shall we stay or run ?</p>

			<p>A LITLE EXTEMPORE</p>
			<p>When they were come into the Faery’s Court They rang⁠—no one at home⁠—all gone to sport And dance and kiss and love as faeries do For Faeries be as humans lovers true. Amid the woods they were so lone and wild. Where even the Robin feels himself exil’d. And where the very brooks, as if afraid, Hurry along to some less magic shade. ‘ No one at home !’ the fretful Princess cry’d ; * And all for nothing such a dreary ride, And all for nothing my new diamond cross; No one to see my Persian feathers toss. No one to see my Ape, my Dwarf, my Fool, Or how I pace my Otaheitan mule.</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-454"/>
			<p>Ape, Dwarf, and Fool, why stand you gaping there,</p>
			<p>Burst the door open, quick⁠—or I declare</p>
			<p>I ’11 switch you soundly and in pieces tear.’</p>
			<p>The Dwarf began to tremble, and the Ape]</p>
			<p>Star’d at the F®ol, the Fool was all agape.</p>
			<p>The Princess grasp’d her switch, but just in time 20</p>
			<p>The dwarf with piteous face began to rhyme.</p>
			<p>* O mighty Princess, did you ne’er hear tell</p>
			<p>What your poor servants know but too too well ?</p>
			<p>Know you the three great crimes in Faeryland ?</p>
			<p>The first, alas ! poor Dwarf, I understand,</p>
			<p>I made a whipstock of a faery’s wand ;</p>
			<p>The next is snoring in their company;</p>
			<p>The next, the last, the direst of the three.</p>
			<p>Is making free when they are not at home.</p>
			<p>I was a Prince⁠—a baby prince⁠—my doom, 30</p>
			<p>You see, I made a whipstock of a wand.</p>
			<p>My top has henceforth slept in faery land.</p>
			<p>He was a Prince, the Fool, a grown-up Prince,</p>
			<p>But he has never been a King’s son since</p>
			<p>He fell a snoring at a faery Ball.</p>
			<p>Yon poor Ape was a Prince, and he poor thing</p>
			<p>Picklock’d a faery’s boudoir⁠—now no king</p>
			<p>But ape⁠—so pray your highness stay awhile,</p>
			<p>‘T is sooth indeed, we know it to our sorrow⁠—</p>
			<p>Persist and you may be an ape to-morrow.’ 40</p>
			<p>While the Dwarf spake, the Princess, all for spite,</p>
			<p>Peel’d the brown hazel twig to lily white,</p>
			<p>Clench’d her small teeth, and held her lips apart,</p>
			<p>Try’d to look unconcern’d with beating heart.</p>
			<p>They saw her highness had made up her mind,</p>
			<p>A-quavering like the reeds before the wind⁠—</p>
			<p>And they had had it, but O happy chance !</p>
			<p>The Ape for very fear began to dance</p>
			<p>And grinn’d as all his ugliness did ache⁠—</p>
			<p>She staid her vixen fingers for his sake, 50</p>
			<p>He was so very ugly : then she took</p>
			<p>Her pocket-mirror and began to look</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-455"/>
			<p>First at herself and then at him, and then</p>
			<p>She smil’d at her own beauteous face again.</p>
			<p>Yet for all this⁠—for all her pretty face⁠—</p>
			<p>She took it in her head to see the place.</p>
			<p>Women gain little from experience</p>
			<p>Either in Lovers, husbands, or expense.</p>
			<p>The more their beauty the more fortune too⁠—</p>
			<p>Beauty before the wide world never knew⁠—60</p>
			<p>So each fair reasons⁠—tho’ it oft miscarries.</p>
			<p>She thought her pretty face would please the faeries.</p>
			<p>‘ My darling Ape, I wont whip you to-day,</p>
			<p>Give me the Picklock sirrah and go play.’</p>
			<p>They all three wept but counsel was as vain</p>
			<p>As crying cup biddy to drops of rain.</p>
			<p>Yet lingering by did the sad Ape forth draw</p>
			<p>The Picklock from the Pocket in his Jaw.</p>
			<p>The Princess took it, and dismounting straight</p>
			<p>Tripp’d in blue silver’d slippers to the gate 70</p>
			<p>And touch’d the wards, the Door full courteous</p>
			<p>Opened⁠—she enter’d with her servants three.</p>
			<p>Again it clos’d and there was nothing seen</p>
			<p>But the Mule grazing on the herbage green.</p>
			<p>End of Canto XII.</p>
			<p>CANTO THE XIII</p>
			<p>The Mule no sooner saw himself alone</p>
			<p>Than he prick’d up his Ears⁠—and said ‘ well done;</p>
			<p>At least unhappy Prince I may be free⁠—</p>
			<p>No more a Princess shall side-saddle me.</p>
			<p>0 King of Otaheite⁠—tho’ a Mule,</p>
			<p>“Aye, every inch a King”⁠—tho’ “Fortune’s</p>
			<p>Fool,” Well done⁠—for by what Mr. Dwarfy said</p>
			<p>1 would not give a sixpence for her head.’ Even as he spake he trotted in high glee</p>
			<p>To the knotty side of an old Pollard tree, 10</p>
			<p>And rubb’d his sides against the mossed bark</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-456"/>
			<p>Till his Girths burst and left him naked stark Except his Bridle⁠—how get rid of that Buckled and tied with many a twist and plait. At last it struck him to pretend to sleep, And then the thievish Monkeys down would creep And filch the unpleasant trammels quite away. No sooner thought of than adown he lay, Shamm’d a good snore⁠—the Monkey-men descended And whom they thought to injure they befriended. They hung his Bridle on a topmost bough 21</p>
			<p>And off he went run, trot, or anyhow⁠—</p>
			<p>SPENSERIAN STANZAS ON CHARLES ARMITAGE BROWN</p>
			<p>He is to weet a melancholy Carle : Thin in the waist, with bushy head of hair, As hath the seeded thistle when in parle It holds the Zephyr, ere it sendeth fair Its light balloons into the summer air; There to his beard had not begun to bloom. No brush had touch’d his chin, or razor sheer; No care had touched his cheek with mortal doom. But new he was, and bright, as scarf from Persian loom,</p>
			<p>Ne cared he for wine, or half-and-half; Ne cared he for fish, or flesh, or fowl; And sauces held he worthless as the chaff; He’s deigned the swineherd at the wassail bowl; Ne with lewd ribbalds sat he cheek by jowl; Ne with sly Lemans in the scorner’s chair ; But after water-brooks this Pilgrim’s soul Panted, and all his food was woodland air; Though he would oft-times feast on gilliflowers rare.</p>
			<p>The slang of cities in no wise he knew ; Tipping the wink to him was heathen Greek ;</p>
			<div class="newpage" id="page-457"/>
			<p>He sipp’d no ‘olden Tom,’ or ‘ruin blue,’ Or Nantz, or cherry-brandy, drunk full meek By many a Damsel hoarse, and rouge of cheek ; Nor did he know each aged Watchman’s beat, Nor in obscured purlieus would he seek For curled Jewesses, with ankles neat, Who, as they walk abroad, make tinkling with their feet.</p>
