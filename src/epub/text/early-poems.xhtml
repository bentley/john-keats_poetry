				<h3>Imitation of Spenser</h3>
				<p>Now Morning from her orient chamber came, And her first footsteps touch’d a verdant hill; Crowning its lawny crest with amber flame, Silv’ring the untainted gushes of its rill; Which, pure from mossy beds, did down distil, And after parting beds of simple flowers, By many streams a little lake did fill, Which round its marge reflected woven bowers, And, in its middle space, a sky that never lowers.</p>
				<p>There the kingfisher saw his plumage bright, Vying with fish of brilliant dye below ; Whose silken fins, and golden scales’ light Cast upward, through the waves, a ruby glow: There saw the swan his neck of arched snow. And oar’d himself along with majesty; Sparkled his jetty eyes ; his feet did show Beneath the waves like Afric’s ebony. And on his back a fay reclined voluptuously.</p>
				<p>Ah ! could I tell the wonders of an isle That in that fairest lake had placed been, I could e’en Dido of her grief beguile ; Or rob from aged Lear his bitter teen :</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-2"/>
				<p>For sure so fair a place was never seen, Of all that ever charm’d romantic eye: It seem’d an emerald in the silver sheen Of the bright waters; or as when on high, Through clouds of fleecy white, laughs the coerulean sky.</p>
				<p>And all around it dipp’d luxuriously Slopings of verdure through the glossy tide, Which, as it were in gentle amity. Rippled delighted up the flowery side; As if to glean the ruddy tears, it tried. Which fell profusely from the rose-tree stem ! Haply it was the workings of its pride, In strife to throw upon the shore a gem Outvying all the buds in Flora’s diadem.</p>

				<h3>On Death</h3>
				<p>Can death be sleep, when life is but a dream, And scenes of bliss pass as a phantom by ?</p>
				<p>The transient pleasures as a vision seem. And yet we think the greatest pain’s to die.</p>
				<p>How strange it is that man on earth should roam. And lead a life of woe, but not forsake</p>
				<p>His rugged path ; nor dare he view alone His future doom, which is but to awake.</p>

				<h3>To Chatterton</h3>
				<p>O Chatteeton ! how very sad thy fate!</p>
				<p>Dear child of sorrow⁠—son of misery!</p>
				<p>How soon the film of death obscur’d that eye, Whence Genius mildly flash’d, and high debate.</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-3"/>
				<p>How soon that voice, majestic and elate, Melted in dying numbers ! Oh ! how nigh Was night to thy fair morning. Thou didst die</p>
				<p>A half-blown flow’ret which cold blasts amate.</p>
				<p>But this is past: thou art among the stars Of highest Heaven : to the rolling spheres</p>
				<p>Thou sweetly singest: nought thy hymning mars, Above the ingrate world and human fears.</p>
				<p>On earth the good man base detraction bars From thy fair name, and waters it with tears.</p>

				<h3>To Byron</h3>
				<p>Bykon ! how sweetly sad thy melody !</p>
				<p>Attuning still the soul to tenderness.</p>
				<p>As if soft Pity, with unusual stress. Had touch’d her plaintive lute, and thou, being by, Hadst caught the tones, nor suffer’d them to die.</p>
				<p>O’ershadowing sorrow doth not make thee less</p>
				<p>Delightful: thou thy griefs dost dress With a bright halo, shining beamily, As when a cloud the golden moon doth veil,</p>
				<p>Its sides are ting’d with a resplendent glow, Through the dark robe oft amber rays prevail.</p>
				<p>And like fair veins in sable marble flow ; Still warble, dying swan ! still tell the tale,</p>
				<p>The enchanting tale, the tale of pleasing woe.</p>

				<h3>‘Woman! When I Behold Thee Flippant, Vain’</h3>
				<p>Woman ! when I behold thee flippant, vain. Inconstant, childish, proud, and full of fancies ; Without that modest softening that enhances</p>
				<p>The downcast eye, repentant of the pain</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-4"/>
				<p>That its mild liglit creates to iieal again : E’en then, elate, my spirit leaps, and prances, E’en then my soul with exultation dances</p>
				<p>For that to love, so long, I ‘ve dormant lain:</p>
				<p>But when I see thee meek, and kind, and tender, Heavens ! how desperately do I adore</p>
				<p>Thy winning graces;⁠—to be thy defender I hotly burn⁠—to be a Calidore⁠—</p>
				<p>A very Red Cross Knight⁠—a stout Leander⁠—Might I be lov’d by thee like these of yore.</p>
				<p>Light feet, dark violet eyes, and parted hair ;</p>
				<p>Soft dimpled hands, white neck, and creamy breast.</p>
				<p>Are things on which the dazzled senses rest Till the fond, fixSd eyes forget they stare. From such fine pictures, Heavens ! I cannot dare</p>
				<p>To turn my admiration, though unpossess’d</p>
				<p>They be of what is worthy⁠—though not drest In lovely modesty, and virtues rare. Yet these I leave as thoughtless as a lark ;</p>
				<p>These lures I straight forget⁠—e’en ere I dine, Or thrice my palate moisten : but when I mark</p>
				<p>Such charms with mild intelligences shine, My ear is open like a greedy shark.</p>
				<p>To catch the tunings of a voice divine.</p>
				<p>Ah ! who can e’er forget so fair a being ?</p>
				<p>Who can forget her half-re tiring sweets ?</p>
				<p>God ! she is like a milk-white lamb that bleats For man’s protection. Surely the All-seeing, Who joys to see us with his gifts agreeing,</p>
				<p>Will never give him pinions, who intreats</p>
				<p>Such innocence to ruin⁠—who vilely cheats A dove-like bosom. In truth there is no freeing One’s thoughts from such a beauty ; when I hear</p>
				<p>A lay that once I saw her hand awake,</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-5"/>
				<p>Her form seems floating palpable, and near: Had I e’er seen her from an arbour take</p>
				<p>A dewy flower, oft would that hand appear, And o’er my eyes the trembling moisture shake.</p>

				<h3>To Some Ladies</h3>
				<p>What though, while the wonders of nature exploring,</p>
				<p>I cannot your light, mazy footsteps attend ; Nor listen to accents, that almost adoring.</p>
				<p>Bless Cynthia’s face, the enthusiast’s friend :</p>
				<p>Yet over the steep, whence the mountain-stream rushes, With you, kindest friends, in idea I rove; Mark the clear tumbling crystal, its passionate gushes. Its spray that the wild flower kindly bedews.</p>
				<p>Why linger you so, the wild labyrinth strolling ?</p>
				<p>Why breathless, unable your bliss to declare ? Ah ! you list to the nightingale’s tender condoling,</p>
				<p>Responsive to sylphs, in the moon-beamy air.</p>
				<p>‘T is morn, and the flowers with dew are yet drooping,</p>
				<p>I see you are treading the verge of the sea: And now ! ah, I see it⁠—you just now are stooping</p>
				<p>To pick up the keepsake intended for me.</p>
				<p>If a cherub, on pinions of silver descending, Had brought me a gem from the fretwork of heaven; And smiles, with his star-cheering voice sweetly blending. The blessings of Tighe had melodiously given;</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-6"/>
				<p>It had not created a warmer emotion Than the present, fair nymphs, I was blest with from you; Than the shell, from the bright golden sands of the ocean, Which the emerald waves at your feet gladly threw.</p>
				<p>For, indeed, ‘t is a sweet and peculiar pleasure, (And blissful is he who such happiness finds,)</p>
				<p>To possess but a span of the hour of leisure. In elegant, pure, and aerial minds.</p>

				<h3>On Receiving a Curious Shell and a Copy of Verses from the Same Ladies</h3>
				<p>Hast thou from the caves of Golconda, a gem Pure as the ice-drop that froze on the mountain ?</p>
				<p>Bright as the humming-bird’s green diadem, When it flutters in sunbeams that shine through a fountain ?</p>
				<p>Hast thou a goblet for dark sparkling wine ?</p>
				<p>That goblet right heavy, and massy, and gold ? And splendidly mark’d with the story divine</p>
				<p>Of Armida the fair, and Rinaldo the bold ?</p>
				<p>Hast thou a steed with a mane richly flowing ?</p>
				<p>Hast thou a sword that thine enemy’s smart is ? Hast thou a trumpet rich melodies blowing ?</p>
				<p>And wear’st thou the shield of the fam’d Brito-martis ?</p>
				<p>What is it that hangs from thy shoulder, so brave, Embroidered with many a spring peering flower ?</p>
				<p>Is it a scarf that thy fair lady gave ? And hastest thou now to that fair lady’s bower ?</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-7"/>
				<p>Ah ! courteous Sir Knight, with large joy thou art crown’d ;</p>
				<p>Full many the glories that brighten thy youth ! I will tell thee my blisses, which richly abound</p>
				<p>In magical powers to bless, and to soothe.</p>
				<p>On this scroll thou seest written in characters fair A sun-beamy tale of a wreath, and a chain:</p>
				<p>And, warrior, it nurtures the property rare Of charming my mind from the trammels of pain.</p>
				<p>This canopy mark : ‘t is the work of a fay;</p>
				<p>Beneath its rich shade did King Oberon languish, When lovely Titania was far, far away.</p>
				<p>And cruelly left him to sorrow, and anguish.</p>
				<p>There, oft would he bring from his soft-sighing lute Wild strains to which, spell-bound, the nightingales listen’d ; The wondering spirits of heaven were mute. And tears ‘mong the dewdrops of morning oft glistened.</p>
				<p>In this little dome, all those melodies strange, Soft, plaintive, and melting, for ever will sigh ;</p>
				<p>Nor e’er will the notes from their tenderness change; Nor e’er will the music of Oberon die.</p>
				<p>So, when I am in a voluptuous vein, I pillow my head on the sweets of the rose.</p>
				<p>And list to the tale pf the wreath, and the chain, Till its echoes depart; then I sink to repose.</p>
				<p>Adieu, valiant Eric ! with joy thou art crown’d ;</p>
				<p>Full many the glories that brighten thy youth, I too have my blisses, which richly abound</p>
				<p>In magical powers, to bless and to soothe.</p>

				<h3>Written on the Day that Mr. Leigh Hunt Left Prison</h3>
				<p>What though, for showing truth to flatter’d state.</p>
				<p>Kind Hunt was shut in prison, yet has he,</p>
				<p>In his immortal spirit, been as free As the sky-searching lark, and as elate. Minion of grandeur ! think you he did wait ?</p>
				<p>Think you he nought hut prison-walls did see.</p>
				<p>Till, so unwilling, thou unturn’dst the key ? Ah, no ! far happier, nobler was his fate ! In Spenser’s halls he strayed, and bowers fair,</p>
				<p>Culling enchanted flowers ; and he flew With daring Milton through the fields of air:</p>
				<p>To regions of his own his genius true Took happy flights. Who shall his fame impair</p>
				<p>When thou art dead, and all thy wretched crew ?</p>

				<h3>To Hope</h3>
				<p>When by my solitary hearth I sit.</p>
				<p>And hateful thoughts enwrap my soul in gloom ; When no fair dreams before my ‘ mind’s eye ‘ flit. And the bare heath of life presents no bloom ; Sweet Hope, ethereal balm upon me shed. And wave thy silver pinions o’er my head.</p>
				<p>Whene’er I wander, at the fall of night.</p>
				<p>Where woven boughs shut out the moon’s bright ray. Should sad Despondency my musings fright. And frown, to drive fair Cheerfulness away, Peep with the moonbeams through the leafy</p>
				<p>roof. And keep that fiend Despondence far aloof.</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-9"/>
				<p>Should Disappointment, parent of Despair,</p>
				<p>Strive for her son to seize my careless heart; When, like a cloud, he sits upon the air, Preparing on his spell-bound prey to dart : Chase him away, sweet Hope, with visage</p>
				<p>bright, And fright him as the morning frightens night!</p>
				<p>Whene’er the fate of those I hold most dear Tells to my fearful breast a tale of sorrow, O bright-eyed Hope, my morbid fancy cheer ; Let me awhile thy sweetest comforts borrow : Thy heaven-born radiance around me shed, And wave thy silver pinions o’er my head !</p>
				<p>Should e’er unhappy love my bosom pain,</p>
				<p>From cruel parents, or relentless fair ; O let me think it is not quite in vain To sigh out sonnets to the midnight air ! Sweet Hope, ethereal balm upon me shed, And wave thy silver pinions o’er my head.</p>
				<p>In the long vista of the years to roll,</p>
				<p>Let me not see our country’s honoiu- fade : O let me see our land retain her soul. Her pride, her freedom ; and not freedom’s shade. From thy bright eyes unusual brightness shed⁠—Beneath thy pinions canopy my head !</p>
				<p>Let me not see the patriot’s high bequest.</p>
				<p>Great Liberty ! how great in plain attire 1 With the base purple of a court oppress’d, Bowing her head, and ready to expire : But let me see thee stoop from heaven on wings That fill the skies with silver glitterings !</p>
				<p>And as, in sparkling maj esty, a star</p>
				<p>Gilds the bright summit of some gloomy cloud</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-10"/>
				<p>Briglitening the half-veil’d face of heaven afar : So, when dark thoughts my boding spirit shroud, Sweet Hope, celestial influence round me shed, Waving thy silver pinions o’er my head.</p>

				<h3>Ode to Apollo</h3>
				<p>In thy western halls of gold</p>
				<p>When thou sittest in thy state, Bards, that erst sublimely told</p>
				<p>Heroic deeds, and sang of fate, With fervour seize their adamantine lyres, Whose chords are solid rays, and twinkle radiant fires.</p>
				<p>Here Homer with his nervous arms</p>
				<p>Strikes the twanging harp of war, And even the western splendor warms,</p>
				<p>While the trumpets sound afar : But, what creates the most intense surprise, His soul looks out through renovated eyes.</p>
				<p>Then, through thy Temple wide, melodious swells The sweet majestic tone of Maro’s lyre :</p>
				<p>The soul delighted on each accent dwells⁠—Enraptur’d dwells⁠—not daring to respire, The while he tells of grief around a funeral pyre.</p>
				<p>‘T is awful silence then again;</p>
				<p>Expectant stand the spheres ;</p>
				<p>Breathless the laurell’d peers. Nor move, till ends the lofty strain, Nor move till Milton’s tuneful thunders cease. And leave once more the ravish’d heavens in peace.</p>
				<p>Thou biddest Shakspeare wave his hand. And quickly forward spring</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-11"/>
				<p>The Passions⁠—a terrific band⁠—</p>
				<p>And each vibrates the string That with its tyrant temper best accords, While from their Master’s lips pour forth the inspiring words.</p>
				<p>A silver trumpet Spenser blows, And, as its martial notes to silence flee,</p>
				<p>From a virgin chorus flows A hymn in praise of spotless Chastity.</p>
				<p>‘T is still! Wild warblings from the iEolian lyre Enchantment softly breathe, and tremblingly expire.</p>
				<p>Next thy Tasso’s ardent numbers</p>
				<p>Float along the pleased air. Calling youth from idle slumbers,</p>
				<p>Rousing them from Pleasure’s lair:⁠—Then o’er the strings his fingers gently move, And melt the soul to pity and to love.</p>
				<p>But when Tfiou joinest with the Nine, And all the powers of song combine,</p>
				<p>We listen here on earth: The dying tones that fill the air, And charm the ear of evening fair, From thee, Great God of Bards, receive their heavenly birth.</p>

				<h3>Hymn to Apollo</h3>
				<p>God of the golden bow,</p>

				<div class="newpage" id="page-12"/>
				<p>When like a blank idiot I put on thy wreath,</p>
				<p>Thy laurel, thy glory,</p>
				<p>The light of thy story, Or was I a worm⁠—too low crawling, for death ? O Delphic Apollo !</p>
				<p>The Thunderer grasp’d and grasp’d,</p>
				<p>The Thunderer frown’d and frown’d; The eagle’s feathery mane For wrath became stiffen’d⁠—the sound Of breeding thunder Went drowsily under, Muttering to be unbound. O why didst thou pity, and for a worm Why touch thy soft lute Till the thunder was mute, Why was not I crush’d⁠—such a pitiful germ ? O Delphic Apollo!</p>
				<p>The Pleiades were up,</p>
				<p>Watching the silent air ; The seeds and roots in the Earth Were swelling for summer fare ; The Ocean, its neighbour. Was at its old labour. When, who⁠—who did dare To tie, like a madman, thy plant round his brow, And grin and look proudly, And blaspheme so loudly, And live for that honour, to stoop to thee now ? O Delphic Apollo ?</p>

				<h3>Epistle to George Felton Mathew</h3>
				<p>Sweet are the pleasures that to verse belong, And doubly sweet a brotherhood in song; Nor can remembrance, Mathew ! bring to view A fate more pleasing, a delight more true Than that in which the brother Poets joy’d, Who, with combined powers, their wit employ’d</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-16"/>
				<p>To raise a trophy to the drama’s muses.</p>
				<p>The thought of this great partnership diffuses</p>
				<p>Over the genius-loving heart, a feeling</p>
				<p>Of all that’s high, and great, and good, and healing.</p>
				<p>Too partial friend! fain would I follow thee n Past each horizon of fine poesy ; Fain would I echo back each pleasant note As o’er Sicilian seas, clear anthems float ‘Mong the light skimming gondolas far parted, Just when the sun his farewell beam has darted : But’t is impossible ; far different cares Beckon me sternly from soft ‘Lydian airs,’ And hold my faculties so long in thrall. That I am oft in doubt whether at all 20</p>
				<p>I shall again see Phoebus in the morning: Or flush’d Aurora in the roseate dawning ! •Or a white Naiad in a rippling stream ; Or a rapt seraph in a moonlight beam ; Or again witness what with thee I’ve seen. The dew by fairy feet swept from the green, After a night of some quaint jubilee Which every elf and fay had come to see : When bright processions took their airy march Beneath the curved moon’s triumphal arch. 30</p>
				<p>But might I now each passing moment give To the coy Muse, with me she would not live In this dark city, nor would condescend ‘Mid contradictions her delights to lend. Should e’er the fine-eyed maid to me be kind. Ah ! surely it must be whene’er I find Some flowery spot, sequester’d, wild, romantic, That often must have seen a poet frantic; Where oaks, that erst the Druid knew, are growing. And flowers, the glory of one day, are blowing ; 40 Where the dark-leav’d laburnum’s drooping clusters Reflect athwart the stream their yellow lustres,</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-17"/>
				<p>And intertwined the cassia’s arms unite, With its own drooping buds, but very white. Where on one side are covert branches hung, ‘Mong which the nightingales have always simg In leafy quiet: where to pry, aloof Atween the pillars of the sylvan roof, Would be to find where violet beds were nestling, And where the bee with cowslip bells was wrestling. 50 There must be too a ruin dark and gloomy. To say ‘ Joy not too much in all that’s bloomy.’</p>
				<p>Yet this is vain⁠—O Mathew, lend thy aid To find a place where I may greet the maid⁠—Where we may soft humanity put on. And sit, and rhyme and think on Chatterton ; And that warm-hearted Shakspeare sent to meet him Four laurell’d spirits, heavenward to entreat him. With reverence would we speak of all the sages Who have left streaks of light athwart their ages:60 And thou shouldst moralize on Milton’s blindness. And mourn the fearful dearth of human kindness To those who strove with the bright golden wing Of genius, to flap away each sting Thrown by the pitiless world. We next could tell Of those who in the cause of freedom fell; Of our own Alfred, of Helvetian Tell; Of him whose name to ev’ry heart’s a solace, High-minded and unbending William Wallace. While to the rugged north our musing turns, 70</p>
				<p>We well might drop a tear for him, and Burns.</p>
				<p>Felton ! without incitements such as these. How vain for me the niggard Muse to tease: For thee, she will thy every dwelling grace. And make ‘ a sunshine in a shady place :’ For thou wast once a flow’ret blooming wild, Close to the source, bright, pure, and undefil’d,</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-18"/>
				<p>Whence gush the streams of song : In happy hour</p>
				<p>Came chaste Diana from her shady bower,</p>
				<p>Just as the sun was from the east uprising ; 80</p>
				<p>And, as for him some gift she was devising,</p>
				<p>Beheld thee, pluck’d thee, cast thee in the stream</p>
				<p>To meet her glorious brother’s greeting beam.</p>
				<p>I marvel much that thou hast never told</p>
				<p>How, from a flower, into a fish of gold</p>
				<p>Apollo chang’d thee: how thou next didst seem</p>
				<p>A black-ey’d swan upon the widening stream;</p>
				<p>And when thou first didst in that mirror trace</p>
				<p>The placid features of a human face :</p>
				<p>That thou hast never told thy travels strange, 90</p>
				<p>And all the wonders of the mazy range</p>
				<p>O’er pebbly crystal, and o’er golden sands ;</p>

				<p>And thy humid eyes that dance</p>
				<p>In the midst of their own brightness</p>
				<p>In the very fane of lightness.</p>
				<p>Over which thine eyebrows, leaning,</p>

				<p>Round about with eager pry. 30</p>
				<p>Saving when, with freshening lave.</p>
				<p>Thou dipp’st them in the taintless wave;</p>
				<p>Like twin water-lilies, born</p>

				<h3>‘I Stood Tiptoe Upon a Little Hill’</h3>
				<p>‘ Places of nestling green, for poets made.’</p>
				<p>Leigh Hunt, The Story of Rimini.</p>
				<p>I STOOD tiptoe upon a little hill, y</p>
				<p>The air was cooling, and so very still ^</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-23"/>
				<p>That the sweet buds which with a modest pride</p>
				<p>Pull droopingly, in slanting curve aside,</p>
				<p>Their scantly-leaved and finely tapering stems,</p>
				<p>Had not yet lost those starry diadems</p>
				<p>Caught from the early sobbing of the morn.</p>
				<p>The clouds were pure and white as flocks new shorn,</p>
				<p>And fresh from the clear brook; sweetly they slept</p>
				<p>On the blue fields of heaven, and then there crept 10</p>
				<p>A little noiseless noise among the leaves,</p>
				<p>Born of the very sigh that silence heaves ;</p>
				<p>For not the faintest motion could be seen</p>
				<p>Of all the shades that slanted o’er the green.</p>
				<p>There was wide wand’ring for the greediest eye</p>
				<p>To peer about upon variety ;</p>
				<p>Far round the horizon’s crystal air to skim,</p>
				<p>And trace the dwindled edgings of its brim;</p>
				<p>To picture out the quaint and curious bending</p>
				<p>Of a fresh woodland alley, never-ending ; 20</p>
				<p>Or by the bowery clefts, and leafy shelves,</p>
				<p>Guess where the jaunty streams refresh themselves.</p>
				<p>I gazed awhile, and felt as light and free</p>
				<p>As though the fanning wings of Mercury</p>
				<p>Had played upon my heels : I was light-hearted,</p>
				<p>And many pleasures to my vision started ;</p>
				<p>So I straightway began to pluck a posey</p>
				<p>Of luxuries bright, milky, soft, and rosy.</p>
				<p>A bush of May flowers with the bees about them ; Ah, sure no tasteful nook could be without them ; 30 And let a lush laburnum oversweep them, And let long grass grow round the roots to keep</p>
				<p>them Moist, cool, and green ; and shade the violets, That they may bind the moss in leafy nets.</p>
				<p>A filbert hedge with wild briar overtwined. And clumps of woodbine taking the soft wind Upon their summer thrones ; there too should be The frequent chequer of a youngling tree,</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-24"/>
				<p>That with a score of light green brethren shoots From the quaint mossiness of aged roots : 40</p>
				<p>Round which is heard a spring-head of clear waters Babbling so wildly of its lovely daughters The spreading blue-bells : it may haply mourn That such fair clusters should be rudely torn From their fresh beds, and scattered thoughtlessly By infant hands, left on the path to die.</p>
				<p>Open afresh your round of starry folds. Ye ardent marigolds !</p>
				<p>Dry up the moisture from your golden lids, For great Apollo bids 50</p>
				<p>That in these days your praises should be sung On many harps, which he has lately strung ; And when again your dewiness he kisses, Tell him, I have you in my world of blisses: So haply when I rove in some far vale. His mighty voice may come upon the gale.</p>
				<p>Here are sweet peas, on tiptoe for a flight: With wings of gentle flush o’er delicate white, And taper fingers catching at all things. To bind them all about with tiny rings. 60</p>
				<p>Linger awhile upon some bending planks That lean against a streamlet’s rushy banks, And watch intently Nature’s gentle doings : They will be found softer than ring-dove’s cooings. How silent comes the water round that bend; Not the minutest whisper does it send To the o’erhanging sallows: blades of grass Slowly across the chequer’d shadows pass. Why, you might read two sonnets, ere they reach To where the hurrying freshnesses aye preach 70 A natural sermon o’er their pebbly beds; Where swarms of minnows show their little heads, Staying their wavy bodies ’gainst the streams,</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-25"/>
				<p>To taste the luxury of sunny beams</p>
				<p>Temper’d with coolness. How they ever wrestle</p>
				<p>“With their own sweet delight, and ever nestle</p>
				<p>Their silver bellies on the pebbly sand.</p>
				<p>If you but scantily hold out the hand,</p>
				<p>That very instant not one will remain ;</p>
				<p>But turn your eye, and they are there again. 80</p>
				<p>The ripples seem right glad to reach those cresses,</p>
				<p>And cool themselves among the em’rald tresses ;</p>
				<p>The while they cool themselves, they freshness give,</p>
				<p>And moisture, that the bowery green may live :</p>
				<p>So keeping up an interchange of favours,</p>
				<p>Like good men in the truth of their behaviours.</p>
				<p>Sometimes goldfinches one by one will drop</p>
				<p>From low-hung branches ; little space they stop ;</p>
				<p>But sip, and twitter, and their feathers sleek ;</p>
				<p>Then off at once, as in a wanton freak : 90</p>
				<p>Or perhaps, to show their black and golden wings,</p>
				<p>Pausing upon their yellow flutterings.</p>
				<p>Were I in such a place, I sure should pray</p>
				<p>That nought less sweet might call my thoughts</p>
				<p>away. Than the soft rustle of a maiden’s gown Fanning away the dandelion’s down ; Than the light music of her nimble toes Patting against the sorrel as she goes. How she would start, and blush, thus to be caught Playing in all her innocence of thought. 100</p>
				<p>O let me lead her gently o’er the brook, Watch her half-smiling lips, and downward look ; O let me for one moment touch her wrist; Let me one moment to her breathing list ; And as she leaves me, may she often turn Her fair eyes looking through her locks auburne. What next ? A tuft of evening primroses, O’er which the mind may hover till it dozes; O’er which it well might take a pleasant sleep, But that ’tis ever startled by the leap no</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-26"/>
				<p>Of buds into ripe flowers; or by the flitting</p>
				<p>Of diverse moths, that aye their rest are quitting ;</p>
				<p>Or by the moon lifting her silver rim</p>
				<p>Above a cloud, and with a gradual swim</p>
				<p>Coming into the blue with all her light.</p>
				<p>O Maker of sweet poets, dear delight</p>
				<p>Of this fair world, and all its gentle livers;</p>
				<p>Spangler of clouds, halo of crystal rivers,</p>
				<p>Mingler with leaves, and dew and tumbling streams,</p>
				<p>Closer of lovely eyes to lovely dreams, 120</p>
				<p>Lover of loneliness, and wandering.</p>
				<p>Of upcast eye, and tender pondering !</p>
				<p>Thee must I praise above all other glories</p>
				<p>That smile us on to tell delightful stories.</p>
				<p>For what has made the sage or poet write</p>
				<p>But the fair paradise of Nature’s light ?</p>
				<p>In the calm grandeur of a sober line,</p>
				<p>We see the waving of the mountain pine ;</p>
				<p>And when a tale is beautifully staid,</p>
				<p>We feel the safety of a hawthorn glade: 130</p>
				<p>When it is moving on luxurious wings,</p>
				<p>The soul is lost in pleasant smotherings :</p>
				<p>Fair dewy roses brush against our faces,</p>
				<p>And flowering laurels spring from diamond vases ;</p>
				<p>O’erhead we see the jasmine and sweet-briar.</p>
				<p>And bloomy grapes laughing from green attire ;</p>
				<p>While at our feet, the voice of crystal bubbles</p>
				<p>Charms us at once away from all our troubles:</p>
				<p>So that we feel uplifted from the world.</p>
				<p>Walking upon the white clouds wreath’d and curl’d.</p>
				<p>So felt he, who first told, how Psyche went 141</p>
				<p>On the smooth wind to realms of wonderment;</p>
				<p>What Psyche felt, and Love, when their full lips</p>
				<p>First touch’d ; what amorous and fondling nips</p>
				<p>They gave each other’s cheeks; with all their sighs,</p>
				<p>And how they kist each other’s tremulous eyes:</p>
				<p>The silver lamp⁠—the ravishment⁠—the wonder⁠—</p>
				<p>The darkness⁠—loneliness⁠—the fearful thunder :</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-27"/>
				<p>Their woes gone by, and both to heaven upflown, To bow for gratitude before Jove’s throne. 150</p>
				<p>So did he feel, who pull’d the boughs aside, That we might look into a forest wide, To catch a glimpse of Fauns, and Dryades Coming with softest rustle through the trees ; And garlands woven of flowers wild, and sweet, Upheld on ivory wrists, or sporting feet: Telling us how fair, trembling Syrinx fled Arcadian Pan, with such a fearful dread. Poor Nymph⁠—poor Pan⁠—how he did weep to</p>
				<p>find Nought but a lovely sighing of the wind 160</p>
				<p>Along the reedy stream; a half-heard strain, Full of sweet desolation⁠—balmy pain.</p>
				<p>What first inspired a bard of old to sing Narcissus pining o’er the untainted spring ? In some delicious ramble, he had found A little space, with boughs all woven round ; And in the midst of all, a clearer pool Than e’er reflected in its pleasant cool. The blue sky here, and there, serenely peeping Through tendril wreaths fantastically creeping. 170 And on the bank a lonely flower he spied, A meek and forlorn flower, with naught of pride. Drooping its beauty o’er the watery clearness. To woo its own sad image into nearness : Deaf to light Zephyrus it would not move ; But still would seem to droop, to pine, to love. So while the Poet stood in this sweet spot, Some fainter gleamings o’er his fancy shot; Nor was it long ere he had told the tale Of young Narcissus, and sad Echo’s bale. 180</p>
				<p>Where had he been, from whose warm head out-flew That sweetest of all songs, that ever new,</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-28"/>
				<p>That aye refreshing, pure deliciousness,</p>
				<p>Coming ever to bless</p>
				<p>The wanderer by moonlight ? to him bringing Shapes from the invisible world, unearthly singing From out the middle air, from flowery nests, And from the pillowy silkiness that rests Full in the speculation of the stars. Ah ! surely he had burst our mortal bars ; 190</p>
				<p>Into some wond’rous region he had gone, To search for thee, divine Endymion !</p>
				<p>He was a Poet, sure a lover too, Who stood on Latmus’ top, what time there blew Soft breezes from the myrtle vale below ; And brought in faintness solemn, sweet, and slow A hymn from Dian’s temple ; while upswelling, The incense went to her own starry dwelling. But though her face was clear as infant’s eyes, Though she stood smiling o’er the sacrifice, 200</p>
				<p>The Poet wept at her so piteous fate, Wept that such beauty should be desolate : So in fine wrath some golden sounds he won. And gave meek Cynthia her Endymion.</p>
				<p>Queen of the wide air ; thou most lovely queen Of all the brightness that mine eyes have seen ! As thou exceedest all things in thy shine, So every tale, does this sweet tale of thine. O for three words of honey, that I might Tell but one wonder of thy bridal night! 210</p>
				<p>Where distant ships do seem to show their keels, Phcfibus awhile delay’d his mighty wheels, And turn’d to smile upon thy bashful eyes, Ere he his unseen pomp would solemnize. The evening weather was so bright, and clear, That men of health were of unusual cheer;</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-29"/>
				<p>Stepping like Homer at the trumpet’s call, Or young Apollo on the pedestal: And lovely women were as fair and warm, As Venus looking sideways in alarm. 220</p>
				<p>The breezes were ethereal, and pure. And crept through half closed lattices to cure The languid sick ; it cool’d their fever’d sleep, And soothed them into slumbers full and deep. Soon they awoke clear-eyed : nor burnt with thirsting^ Nor with hot fingers, nor with temples bursting : And springing up, they met the wond’ring sight Of their dear friends, nigh foolish with delight; Who feel their arms, and breasts, and kiss and stare. And on their placid foreheads part the hair. 230</p>
				<p>Young men and maidens at each other gaz’d, With hands held back, and motionless, amaz’d To see the brightness in each other’s eyes ; And so they stood, fill’d with a sweet surprise, Until their tongues were loos’d in poesy. Therefore no lover did of anguish die : But the soft numbers, in that moment spoken, Made silken ties, that never may be broken. Cynthia ! I cannot tell the greater blisses That follow’d thine, and thy dear shepherd’s kisses: 240</p>
				<p>Was there a Poet born ?⁠—But now no more, My wand’ring spirit must no further soar.</p>

				<div class="newpage" id="page-30"/>
				<p>That stays one moment in an open flower,</p>

				<p>What is more tranquil than a musk-rose blowing</p>
				<p>In a green island, far from all men’s knowing ?</p>
				<p>More healthful than the leafiness of dales ?</p>
				<p>More secret than a nest of nightingales ?</p>
				<p>More serene than Cordelia’s countenance ?</p>
				<p>More full of visions than a high romance ? lo</p>
				<p>What, but thee, Sleep ? Soft closer of our eyes 1</p>
				<p>Low murmurer of tender lullabies !</p>
				<p>Light hoverer around our happy pillows !</p>
				<p>Wreather of poppy buds, and weeping willows !</p>
				<p>Silent entangler of a beauty’s tresses !</p>
				<p>Most happy listener ! when the morning blesses</p>
				<p>Thee for enlivening all the cheerful eyes</p>
				<p>That glance so brightly at the new sunrise.</p>
				<p>But what is higher beyond thought than thee ? Fresher than berries of a mountain-tree ? 20</p>
				<p>More strange, more beautiful, more smooth, more</p>
				<p>regal, Than wings of swans, than doves, than dim-seen</p>
				<p>eagle ? What is it ? And to what shall I compare it ? It has a glory, and nought else can share it: The thought thereof is awful, sweet, and holy, Chasing away all worldliness and folly: Coming sometimes like fearful claps of thunder. Or the low rumblings earth’s regions under; And sometimes like a gentie whispering , Of all the secrets of some wond’rous thing 30</p>
				<p>That breathes about us in the vacant air; So that we look around with prying stare, Perhaps to see shapes of light, aerial limning ; And catch soft floatings from a faint-heard hymning; To see the laurel wreath, on high suspended, That is to crown our name when life is ended.</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-31"/>
				<p>Sometimes it gives a glory to the voice, And from the heart up-springs, rejoice ! rejoice! Sounds which will reach the Framer of all things, And die away in ardent mutteriugs. 40</p>
				<p>No one who once the glorious sun has seen, And all the clouds, and felt his bosom clean For his great Maker’s presence, but must know What’t is I mean, and feel his being glow : Therefore no insult will I give his spirit, By telling what he sees from native merit.</p>
				<p>O Poesy ! for thee I hold my pen. That am not yet a glorious denizen Of thy wide heaven⁠—should I rather kneel Upon some mountain-top until I feel 50</p>
				<p>A growing splendour round about me hung. And echo back the voice of thine own tongue ? O Poesy! for thee I grasp my pen. That am not yet a glorious denizen Of thy wide heaven; yet, to my ardent prayer, Yield from thy sanctuary some clear air, Smoothed for intoxication by the breath Of flowering bays, that I may die a death Of luxury, and my young spirit follow The morning sunbeams to the great Apollo 60</p>
				<p>Like a fresh sacrifice ; or, if I can bear The o’erwhelming sweets, ‘t will bring to me the</p>
				<p>fair Visions of all places: a bowery nook Will be elysium⁠—an eternal book Whence I may copy many a lovely saying About the leaves, and flowers⁠—about the playing Of nymphs in woods, and fountains; and the shade Keeping a silence round a sleeping maid ; And many a verse from so strange influence That we must ever wonder how, and whence 70</p>
				<p>It came. Also imaginings will hover</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-32"/>
				<p>Round my fire-side, and haply there discover</p>
				<p>Vistas of solemn beauty, where I ‘d wander</p>
				<p>In happy silence, like the clear Meander</p>
				<p>Through its lone vales ; and where I found a spot</p>
				<p>Of awfuller shade, or an enchanted grot.</p>
				<p>Or a green hill o’erspread with chequer’d dress</p>
				<p>Of flowers, and fearful from its loveliness,</p>
				<p>Write on my tablets all that was permitted,</p>
				<p>All that was for our human senses fitted. 80</p>
				<p>Then the events of this wide world I ‘d seize</p>
				<p>Like a strong giant, and my spirit tease</p>
				<p>Till at its shoulders it should proudly see</p>
				<p>Wings to find out an immortality.</p>
				<p>Stop and consider ! life is but a day; A fragile dewdrop on its perilous way From a tree’s summit; a poor Indian’s sleep While his boat hastens to the monstrous steep Of Montmorenci. Why so sad a moan ? Life is the rose’s hope while yet unblown ; 90</p>
				<p>The reading of an ever-changing tale ; The light uplifting of a maiden’s veil; A pigeon tumbling in clear summer air ; A laughing school-boy, without grief or care, Riding the springy branches of an elm.</p>
				<p>O for ten years, that I may overwhelm Myself in poesy ; so I may do the deed That my own soul has to itself decreed. Then I will pass the countries that I see In long perspective, and continually 100</p>
				<p>Taste their pure fountains. First the realm I’ll</p>
				<p>pass Of Flora, and old Pan: sleep in the grass, Feed upon apples red, and strawberries. And choose each pleasure that my fancy sees ; Catch the white-handed nymphs in shady places, • To woo sweet kisses from averted faces⁠—</p>

				<p>May fan the cool air gently o’er my rest;</p>
				<p>Another, bending o’er her nimble tread.</p>
				<p>Will set a green robe floating round her head,</p>
				<p>And still will dance with ever-varied ease.</p>
				<p>Smiling upon the flowers and the trees :</p>
				<p>Another will entice me on, and on</p>
				<p>Through almond blossoms and rich cinnamon;</p>
				<p>Till in the bosom of a leafy world</p>
				<p>We rest in silence, like two gems upcurl’d 120</p>
				<p>In the recesses of a pearly shell.</p>
				<p>And can I ever bid these joys farewell? Yes, I must pass them for a nobler life, Where I may find the agonies, the strife Of human hearts : for lo ! I see afar, O’ersailing the blue cragginess, a car And steeds with streamy manes⁠—the charioteer Looks out upon the winds with glorious fear : And now the numerous tramplings quiver lightly Along a huge cloud’s ridge; and now with sprightly 130</p>
				<p>Wheel downward come they into fresher skies, Tipt round with silver from the sun’s bright eyes. Still downward with capacious whirl they glide; And now I see them on a green-hill’s side In breezy rest among the nodding stalks. The charioteer with wond’rous gesture talks To the trees and mountains ; and there soon appear Shapes of delight, of mystery, and fear. Passing along before a dusky space Made by some mighty oaks : as they would chase 140 Some ever-fleeting music, on they sweep. Lo ! how they murmur, laugh, and smile, and weep:</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-34"/>
				<p>Some with upholden hand and mouth severe; Some with their faces muffled to the ear Between their arms; some, clear in youthful bloom. Go glad and smilingly athwart the gloom ; Some looking back, and some with upward gaze; Yes, thousands in a thousand different ways Flit onward⁠—now a lovely wreath of girls Dancing their sleek hair into tangled curls ; 150</p>
				<p>And now broad wings. Most awfully intent The driver of those steeds is forward bent, And seems to listen : O that I might know All that he writes with such a hurrying glow.</p>
				<p>The visions all are fled⁠—the car is fled Into the light of heaven, and in their stead A sense of real things comes doubly strong, And, like a muddy stream, would bear along My soul to nothingness: but I will strive Against all doubtings, and will keep alive 160</p>
				<p>The thought of that same chariot, and the strange Journey it went.</p>
				<p>Is there so small a range In the present strength of manhood, that the high Imagination cannot freely fly As she was wont of old ? prepare her steeds. Paw up against the light, and do strange deeds Upon the clouds ? Has she not shewn us all ? From the clear space of ether, to the small Breath of new buds unfolding ? From the meaning Of Jove’s large eyebrow, to the tender greening 170 Of April meadows ? here her altar shone, E’en in this isle ; and who could paragon The fervid choir that lifted up a noise Of harmony, to where it aye will poise Its mighty self of convoluting sound, Huge as a planet, and like that roll round,</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-35"/>
				<p>Eternally around a dizzy void ?</p>
				<p>Ay, in those days the Muses were nigh cloy’d</p>
				<p>With honours ; nor had any other care</p>
				<p>Than to sing out and soothe their wavy hair. 180</p>
				<p>Could all this be forgotten ? Yes, a schism Nurtured by foppery and barbarism, Made great Apollo blush for this his land. Men were thought wise who could not understand His glories : with a puling infant’s force They sway’d about upon a rocking-horse. And thought it Pegasus. Ah, dismal-soul’d ! The winds of heaven blew, the ocean roll’d Its gathering waves⁠—ye felt it not. The blue Bared its eternal bosom, and the dew 190</p>
				<p>Of summer nights collected still to make The morning precious : beauty was awake ! Why were ye not awake ? But ye were dead To things ye knew not of⁠—were closely wed To musty laws lined out with wretched rule And compass vile : so that ye taught a school Of dolts to smooth, inlay, and clip, and fit, Till, like the certain wands of Jacob’s wit, Their verses tallied. Easy was the task : A thousand handicraftsmen wore the mask 200</p>
				<p>Of Poesy. Ill-fated, impious race ! That blasphem’d the bright Lyrist to his face, And did not know it⁠—no, they went about, Holding a poor, decrepid standard out, Mark’d with most flimsy mottoes, and in large The name of one Boileau !</p>
				<p>O ye whose charge It is to hover round our pleasant hills! Whose congregated majesty so fills My boundly reverence, that I cannot trace Your hallowed names, in this unholy place, 210</p>
				<p>So near those common folk ; did not their shames</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-36"/>
				<p>Affright you ? Did our old lamenting Thames Delight you ? did ye never cluster round Delicious Avon, with a mournful sound, And weep ? Or did ye wholly bid adieu To regions where no more the laurel grew ? Or did ye stay to give a welcoming To some lone spirits who could proudly sing Their youth away, and die ? ‘T was even so: But let me think away those times of woe : 220</p>
				<p>Now ‘t is a fairer season; ye have breathed Rich benedictions o’er us; ye have wreathed Fresh garlands : for sweet music has been heard In many places ;⁠—some has been upstirr’d From out its crystal dwelling in a lake, By a swan’s ebon bill; from a thick brake, Nested and quiet in a valley mild, Bubbles a pipe ; fine sounds are floating wild About the earth : happy are ye and glad. These things are, doubtless ; yet in truth we ‘ve had 230</p>
				<p>Strange thunders from the potency of song ; Mingled indeed with what is sweet and strong From maj esty : but in clear truth the themes Are ugly clubs, the Poets Polyphemes Disturbing the grand sea. A drainless shower Of light is Poesy ; ‘t is the supreme of power ; ‘T is might half slumb’ring on its own right arm. The very archings of her eyelids charm A thousand willing agents to obey. And still she governs with the mildest sway : 240 But strength alone though of the Muses born Is like a fallen angel: trees uptorn. Darkness, and worms, and shrouds, and sepulchres Delight it; for it feeds upon the burrs And thorns of life ; forgetting the great end Of Poesy, that it should be a friend To soothe the cares, and lift the thoughts of man.</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-37"/>
				<p>Yet I rej oice : a myrtle fairer than E’er grow in Paplios, from the bitter weeds Lifts its sweet head into the air, and feeds 250</p>
				<p>A silent space with ever sprouting green. All tenderest birds there find a pleasant screen, Creep through the shade with jaunty fluttering, Nibble the little cupped flowers and sing. Then let us clear away the choking thorns From round its gentle stem ; let the young fawns, Yeaned in after-times, when we are flown, Find a fresh sward beneath it, overgrown With simple flowers: let there nothing be More boisterous than a lover’s bended knee ; 260</p>
				<p>Nought more ungentle than the placid look Of one who leans upon a closed book; Nought more untranquil than the grassy slopes Between two hills. All hail, delightful hopes ! As she was wont, th’ imagination Into most lovely labyrinths will be gone, And they shall be accounted poet kings Who simply tell the most heart-easing things. O may these joys be ripe before I die.</p>
				<p>Will not some say that I presumptuously 270</p>
				<p>Have spoken ? that from hastening disgrace ‘T were better far to hide my foolish face ? That whining boyhood should with reverence bow Ere the dread thunderbolt could reach ? How ! If I do hide myself, it sure shall be In the very fane, the light of Poesy : If I do fall, at least I will be laid Beneath the silence of a poplar shade ; And over me the grass shall be smooth shaven ; And there shall be a kind memorial graven. 280</p>
				<p>But off, Despondence ! miserable bane ! They should not know thee, who athirst to gain A noble end, are thirsty every hour. What though I am not wealthy in the dower</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-38"/>
				<p>Of spanning wisdom ; though I do not know</p>
				<p>The shiftings of the mighty winds that blow</p>
				<p>Hither and thither all the changing thoughts</p>
				<p>Of man : though no great minist’ring reason sorts</p>
				<p>Out the dark mysteries of human souls</p>
				<p>To clear conceiving: yet there ever rolls 290</p>
				<p>A vast idea before me, and I glean</p>
				<p>Therefrom my liberty ; thence too I ‘ve seen</p>
				<p>The end and aim of Poesy. ‘T is clear</p>
				<p>As anything most true ; as that the year</p>
				<p>Is made of the four seasons⁠—manifest</p>
				<p>As a large cross, some old cathedral’s crest.</p>
				<p>Lifted to the white clouds. Therefore should I</p>
				<p>Be but the essence of deformity,</p>
				<p>A coward, did my very eyelids wink</p>
				<p>At speaking out what I have dared to think. 300</p>
				<p>Ah ! rather let me like a madman run</p>
				<p>Over some precipice ; let the hot sun</p>
				<p>Melt my Daedalian wings, and drive me down</p>
				<p>Convuls’d and headlong ! Stay ! an inward frown</p>
				<p>Of conscience bids me be more calm awhile.</p>
				<p>An ocean dim, sprinkled with many an isle,</p>
				<p>Spreads awfully before me. How much toil!</p>
				<p>How many days ! what desperate turmoil!</p>
				<p>Ere I can have explored its widenesses.</p>
				<p>Ah, what a task! upon my bended knees, 310</p>
				<p>1 could unsay those⁠—no, impossible !</p>
				<p>Impossible!</p>
				<p>For sweet relief I ’11 dwell On humbler thoughts, and let this strange assay Begun in gentleness die so away. E’en now all tumult from my bosom fades : I turn full-hearted to the friendly aids That smooth the path of honour ; brotherhood, And friendliness the nurse of mutual good. The hearty grasp that sends a pleasant sonnet Into the brain ere one can think upon it; 320</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-39"/>
				<p>The silence when some rhymes are coming out; And when they ‘re come, the very pleasant rout: The message certain to be done to-morrow. ‘T is perhaps as well that it should be to borrow Some precious book from out its snug retreat, To cluster round it when we next shall meet. Scarce can I scribble on ; for lovely airs Are fluttering round the room like doves in pairs; Many delights of that glad day recalling, When first my senses caught their tender falling. 330 And with these airs come forms of elegance Stooping their shoulders o’er a horse’s prance, Careless, and grand⁠—fingers soft and round Parting luxuriant curls :⁠—and the swift bound Of Bacchus from his chariot, when his eye Made Ariadne’s cheek look blushingly. Thus I remember all the pleasant flow Of words at opening a portfolio.</p>
				<p>Things such as these are ever harbingers To trains of peaceful images : the stirs 340</p>
				<p>Of a swan’s neck unseen among the rushes : A linnet starting all about the bushes: A butterfly, with golden wings broad parted, Nestling a rose, convuls’d as though it smarted With over pleasure⁠—many, many more, Might I indulge at large in all my store Of luxuries : yet I must not forget Sleep, quiet with his poppy coronet: For what there may be worthy in these rhymes I partly owe to him : and thus, the chimes 350</p>
				<p>Of friendly voices had just given place To as sweet a silence, when I ‘gan retrace The pleasant day, upon a couch at ease. It was a poet’s house who keeps the keys Of pleasiue’s temple. Round about were hung The glorious features of the bards who sung</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-40"/>
				<p>In other ages⁠—cold and sacred busts</p>
				<p>Smiled at each other. Happy he who trusts</p>
				<p>To clear Futurity his darling fame !</p>
				<p>Then there were fauns and satyrs taking aim 360</p>
				<p>At swelling apples with a frisky leap</p>
				<p>And reaching fingers, ‘mid a luscious heap</p>
				<p>Of vine leaves. Then there rose to view a fane</p>
				<p>Of liny marble, and thereto a train</p>
				<p>Of nymphs approaching fairly o’er the sward :</p>
				<p>One, loveliest, holding her white hand toward</p>
				<p>The dazzling sunrise : two sisters sweet</p>
				<p>Bending their graceful figures till they meet</p>
				<p>Over the trippings of a little child :</p>
				<p>And some are hearing, eagerly, the wild 370</p>
				<p>Thrilling liquidity of dewy piping.</p>
				<p>See, in another picture, nymphs are wiping</p>
				<p>Cherishingly Diana’s timorous limbs ;⁠—</p>
				<p>A fold of lawny mantle dabbling swims</p>
				<p>At the bath’s edge, and keeps a gentle motion</p>
				<p>With the subsiding crystal: as when ocean</p>
				<p>Heaves calmly its broad swelling smoothiness o’er</p>
				<p>Its rocky marge, and balances once more</p>
				<p>The patient weeds ; that now unshent by foam</p>
				<p>Feel all about their undulating home. 380</p>
				<p>Sappho’s meek head was there half smiling down At nothing ; just as though the earnest frown Of over-thinking had that moment gone From off her brow, and left her all alone.</p>
				<p>Great Alfred’s too, with anxious, pitying eyes. As if he always listened to the sighs Of the goaded world ; and Kosciusko’s, worn By horrid suffrance⁠—mightily forlorn.</p>
				<p>Petrarch, outstepping from the shady green. Starts at the sight of Laura ; nor can wean 390</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-41"/>
				<p>His eyes from her sweet face. Most happy they !</p>
				<p>For over them was seen a free display</p>
				<p>Of outspread wings, and from between them shone</p>
				<p>The face of Poesy : from off her throne</p>
				<p>She overlook’d things that I scarce could tell.</p>
				<p>The very sense of where I was might well</p>
				<p>Keep Sleep aloof : but more than that there came</p>
				<p>Thought after thought to nourish up the flame</p>
				<p>Within my breast; so that the morning light</p>
				<p>Surprised me even from a sleepless night; 40.</p>
				<p>And up I rose refresh’d, and glad, and gay,</p>
				<p>Resolving to begin that very day</p>
				<p>These lines ; and howsoever they be done,</p>
				<p>I leave them as a father does his son.</p>

				<h3>Epistle to My Brother George</h3>
				<p>Full many a dreary hour have I past. My brain bewilder’d, and my mind o’ercast With heaviness ; in seasons when I ‘ve thought No spherey strains by me could e’er be caught From the blue dome, though I to dimness gaze On the far depth where sheeted lightning plays; Or, on the wavy grass outstretch’d supinely, Pry ‘mong the stars, to strive to think divinely : That I should never hear Apollo’s song. Though feathery clouds were floating all along 10 The purple west, and, two bright streaks between, The golden lyre itself were dimly seen : That the still murmur of the honey bee Would never teach a rural song to me : That the bright glance from beauty’s eyelids slanting Would never make a lay of mine enchanting, Or warm my breast with ardour to unfold Some tale of love and arms in time of old.</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-42"/>
				<p>But there are times, when those that love the bay, Fly from all sorrowing far, far away ; 20</p>
				<p>A sudden glow comes on them, nought they see In water, earth, or air, but poesy. It has been said, dear George, and true I hold it, (For knightly Spenser to Libertas told it,) That when a Poet is in such a trance, In air he sees white coursers paw and prance, Bestridden of gay knights, in gay apparel. Who at each other tilt in playful quarrel; And what we, ignorantly, sheet-lightning call. Is the swift opening of their wide portal, 30</p>
				<p>When the bright warder blows his trumpet clear, Whose tones reach nought on earth but Poefs</p>
				<p>ear. When these enchanted portals open wide, And through the light the horsemen swiftly glide, The Poet’s eye can reach those golden halls, And view the glory of their festivals : Their ladies fair, that in the distance seem Fit for the silv’ring of a seraph’s dream ; Their rich brimm’d goblets, that incessant run Like the bright spots that move about the sun ; 40 And, when upheld, the wine from each bright jar Pours with the lustre of a falling star. Yet further off are dimly seen their bowers, Of which no mortal eye can reach the flowers; And ‘t is right just, for well Apollo knows ‘T would make the Poet quarrel with the rose. All that’s reveal’d from that far seat of blisses, Is, the clear fountains’ interchanging kisses, As gracefully descending, light and thin, Like silver streaks across a dolphin’s fin, 50</p>
				<p>When he upswimmeth from the coral caves. And sports with half his tail above the waves.</p>
				<p>These wonders strange he sees, and many more, Whose head is pregnant with poetic lore.</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-43"/>
				<p>Should he upon an evening ramble fare With forehead to the soothing breezes bare, Would he nought see but the dark, silent blue, With all its diamonds trembling through and</p>
				<p>through ? Or the coy moon, when in the waviness Of whitest clouds she does her beauty dress, 60</p>
				<p>And staidly paces higher up, and higher, Like a sweet nun in holiday attire ? Ah, yes ! much more would start into his sight⁠—The revelries, and mysteries of ni,^ht: And should I ever see them, I will tell you Such tales as needs must with amazement spell</p>
				<p>you.</p>
				<p>These are the living pleasures of the bard : But richer far posterity’s award. What does he murmur with his lairst breath, While his proud eye looks th:ough the film of death ? 70</p>
				<p>‘What though I leave this dull a’^; i earthl^ ‘■► -^iil’^ Yet shall my spirit lofty converse : Ul .</p>
				<p>With after times. — The patriot si m i^>. My stern alarum, and unsheath his stee! .

Gay villagers, upon a morn of May, When they have tired their genti^ limbs with pby, And form’d a snowy circle on ti. grass, And plac’d in midst of all that io vely lass Who chosen is their queen⁠—with her fine bead Crowned with flowers purple, white, and red:</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-44"/>
				<p>For there the lily, and the musk-rose, sighing, Are emblems true of hapless lovers dying ; 90</p>
				<p>Between her breasts, that never yet felt trouble, A bunch of violets full blown, and double, Serenely sleep :⁠—she from a casket takes A little book⁠—and then a joy awakes About each youthful heart⁠—with stifled cries, And rubbing of white hands, and sparkling eyes: For she’s to read a tale of hopes and fears; One that I foster’d in my youthful years: The pearls, that on each glist’ning circlet sleep. Gush ever and anon with silent creep, 100</p>
				<p>Lured by the innocent dimples. To sweet rest Shall the dear babe, upon its mother’s breast, Be lull’d with songs of mine. Fair world, adieu ! Thy dales and hills ai(u faaing^from my view: Swiftly I mount, upon wide-spreading pinions, Far from the narrow bounds of thy dominions. Full joy 1 feel, while thus I cleave the air, That njy S’..[t verse will charm tliy daughters fair. And warm thy sons !’ Ah, my dear friend and . her,</p>
				<p>; once, my mad ambition smother, no</p>
				<p>; joys like these, sure I should be nd dearer to society. 1 is true, I’ve felt relief from pain .’J bright thought has darted through my brain: Through all that dty T ‘ve felt a greater pleasure Than if I ‘d brough: to light a hidden treasure. As to my sonnets, though none else should heed</p>
				<p>them, I feel delighted, still, that you should read them. Of late, too, I have had much calm enjoyment, Stretch’d on the grass at my best lov’d employment 120 Of scribbling lines for you. These things I thought While, in my face, thy freshest breeze I caught.</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-45"/>
				<p>E’en now I’m pillow’d on a bed of flowers</p>
				<p>That crowns a lofty cliff, which proudly towers</p>
				<p>Above the ocean waves. The stalks and blades</p>
				<p>Chequer my tablet with their quivering shades.</p>
				<p>On one side is a field of drooping oats,</p>
				<p>Through which the poppies show their scarlet</p>
				<p>coats; So pert and useless, that they bring to mind The scarlet coats that pester human-kind. 130</p>
				<p>And on the other side, outspread, is seen Ocean’s blue mantle, streak’d with purple, and</p>
				<p>green ; Now ‘t is I see a canvass’d ship, and now Mark the bright silver curling round her prow. I see the lark down-dropping to his nest. And the broad-winged sea-^all jcver at rest; For when no more he spreads his feathers free, His breast is dancing on the restless sea. Now I direct my eyes into the west. Which at this moment is in sunbeams drest: 140</p>
				<p>Why westward turn ? ‘T was but to say adieu ! ‘T was but to kiss my hand, dear George, to you !</p>

				<h3>Specimen of an Induction to a Poem</h3>
				<p>Lo ! I must tell a tale of chivalry ;</p>
				<p>For large white plumes are dancing in mine eye.</p>
				<p>Not like the formal crest of latter days:</p>
				<p>But bending in a thousand graceful ways;</p>
				<p>So graceful, that it seems no mortal hand,</p>
				<p>Or e’en the touch of Archimago’s wand,</p>
				<p>Could charm them into such an attitude.</p>
				<p>We must think rather, that in playful mood.</p>
				<p>Some mountain breeze had turned its chief delight.</p>
				<p>To show this wonder of its gentle might. ic</p>
				<p>Lo ! I must tell a tale of chivalry ;</p>
				<p>For while I muse, the lance points slantingly</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-47"/>
				<p>Athwart the morning air ; some lady sweet, Who cannot feel for cold her tender feet, From the worn top of some old battlement Hails it with tears, her stout defender sent: And from her own pure self no joy dissembling. Wraps round her ample robe with happy trembling. Sometimes, when the good Knight his rest would</p>
				<p>take. It is reflected, clearly, in a lake, 20</p>
				<p>With the young ashen boughs, ’gainst which it</p>
				<p>rests, And th’ half-seen mossiness of linnets’ nests. Ah ! shall I ever tell its cruelty, When the fire flashes from a warrior’s eye, And his tremendous hand is grasping it. And his dark brow for very wrath is knit ? Or when his spirit, with more calm intent, Leaps to the honours of a tournament, And makes the gazers round about the ring Stare at the grandeur of the balancing ? 30</p>
				<p>No, no ! this is far off :⁠—then how shall I Revive the dying tones of minstrelsy, Which linger yet about long gothic arches, In dark green ivy, and among wild larches ? How sing the splendour of the revelries, When butts of wine are drunk off to the lees ? And that bright lance, against the fretted wall, Beneath the shade of stately banneral. Is slung with shining cuirass, sword, and shield ? Where ye may see a spur in bloody field. 40</p>
				<p>Light-footed damsels move with gentle paces Round the wide hall, and show their happy faces ; Or stand in courtly talk by fives and sevens: Like those fair stars that twinkle in the heavens. Yet must I tell a tale of chivalry : Or wherefore comes that knight so proudly by ? Wherefore more proudly does the gentle knight Rein in the swelling of his ample might ?</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-48"/>
				<p>Spenser ! thy brows are arched, open, kind, And come like a clear sunrise to my mind ; 50</p>
				<p>And always does my heart with pleasure dance, When I think on thy noble countenance ; Where never yet was ought more earthly seen Than the pure freshness of thy laurels green. Therefore, great bard, I not so fearfully Call on thy gentle spirit to hover nigh My daring steps : or if thy tender care, Thus startled unaware. Be jealous that the foot of other wight Should madly follow that bright path of light 60 Trac’d by thy lov’d Libertas; he will speak. And tell thee that my prayer is very meek; That I will follow with due reverence. And start with awe at mine own strange pretence. Him thou wilt hear ; so I will rest in hope To see wide plains, fair trees, and lawny slope : The morn, the eve, the light, the shade, the flowers; Clear streams, smooth lakes, and overlooking towers.</p>

				<h3>Calidore</h3>
				<p>A FRAGMENT</p>
				<p>Young Calidore is paddling o’er the lake ;</p>
				<p>His healthful spirit eager and awake</p>
				<p>To feel the beauty of a silent eve,</p>
				<p>Which seem’d full loth this happy world to leave ;</p>
				<p>The light dwelt o’er the scene so lingeringly.</p>
				<p>He bares his forehead to the cool blue sky,</p>
				<p>And smiles at the far clearness all around,</p>
				<p>Until his heart is well nigh over wound</p>
				<p>And turns for calmness to the pleasant green</p>
				<p>Of easy slopes, and shadowy trees that lean i</p>
				<p>So elegantly o’er the waters’ brim</p>
				<p>And show their blossoms trim.</p>
				<p>\</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-49"/>
				<p>Scarce can his clear and nimble eyesight follow The freaks and dartings of the black-wing’d swallow, Delighting much, to see it half at rest, Dip so refreshingly its wings, and breast ’Gainst the smooth surface, and to mark anon, The widening circles into nothing gone.</p>
				<p>And now the sharp keel of his little boat Comes up with ripple, and with easy float, 20</p>
				<p>And glides into a bed of water-lilies : Broad-leav’d are they, and their white canopies Are upward turn’d to catch the heavens’ dew. Near to a little island’s point they grew ; Whence Calidore might have the goodliest view Of this sweet spot of earth. The bowery shore Went off in gentle windings to the hoar And light blue mountains : but no breathing man With a warm heart, and eye prepared to scan Nature’s clear beauty, could pass lightly by 30</p>
				<p>Objects that look’d out so invitingly On either side. These, gentle Calidore Greeted, as he had known them long before.</p>
				<p>The sidelong view of swelling leafiness. Which the glad setting sun in gold doth dress; Whence, ever and anon, the jay outsprings, And scales upon the beauty of its wings.</p>
				<p>The lonely turret, shatter’d, and outworn, Stands venerably proud ; too proud to mourn Its long lost grandeur: fir-trees grow around, 40</p>
				<p>Aye dropping their hard fruit upon the ground.</p>
				<p>The little chapel, with the cross above, Upholding wreaths of ivy ; the white dove, That on the windows spreads his feathers light, And seems from purple clouds to wing its flight.</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-50"/>
				<p>Green tufted islands casting their soft shades Across the lake ; sequester’d leafy glades, That through the dimness of their twilight show-Large dock-leaves, spiral foxgloves, or the glow Of the cat’s wild eyes, or the silvery stems 50</p>
				<p>Of delicate birch-trees, or long grass which hems A little brook. The youth had long been viewing These pleasant things, and heaven was bedewing The mountain flowers, when his glad senses caught A trumpet’s silver voice. Ah! it was fraught With many joys for him: the warder’s ken Had found white coursers prancing in the glen ; Friends very dear to him he soon will see ; So pushes off his boat most eagerly. And soon upon the lake he skims along, 60</p>
				<p>Deaf to the nightingale’s first under-song ; Nor minds he the white swans that dream so</p>
				<p>sweetly: His spirit flies before him so completely.</p>
				<p>And now he turns a jutting point of land, Whence may be seen the castle gloomy, and grand: Nor will a bee buzz round two swelling peaches, Before the point of his light shallop reaches Those marble steps that through the water dip : Now over them he goes with hasty trip. And scarcely stays to ope the folding doors : 70</p>
				<p>Anon he leaps along the oaken floors Of halls and corridors.</p>
				<p>Delicious sounds ! those little bright-eyed things That float about the air on azure wings, Had been less heartfelt by him than the clang Of clattering hoofs; into the court he sprang. Just as two noble steeds, and palfreys twain, Were slanting out their necks with loosen’d rein;</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-51"/>
				<p>While from beneath the threat’ning portcullis</p>
				<p>They brought their happy burthens. What a kiss,</p>
				<p>What gentle squeeze he gave each lady’s hand ! 8i</p>
				<p>How tremblingly their delicate ankles spann’d !</p>
				<p>Into how sweet a trance his soul was gone,</p>
				<p>While whisperings of affection</p>
				<p>Made him delay to let their tender feet</p>
				<p>Come to the earth ; with an incline so sweet</p>
				<p>From their low palfreys o’er his neck they bent:</p>
				<p>And whether there were tears of languishment,</p>
				<p>Or that the evening dew had pearl’d their tresses,</p>
				<p>He feels a moisture on his cheek, and blesses 90</p>
				<p>With lips that tremble, and with glistening eye,</p>
				<p>All the soft luxury</p>
				<p>That nestled in his arms. A dimpled hand,</p>
				<p>Fair as some wonder out of fairy land,</p>
				<p>Hung from his shoulder like the drooping flowers</p>
				<p>Of whitest Cassia, fresh from summer showers :</p>
				<p>And this he fondled with his happy cheek,</p>
				<p>As if for 3 oy he would no further seek;</p>
				<p>When the kind voice of good Sir Clerimond</p>
				<p>Came to his ear, like something from beyond 100</p>
				<p>His present being : so he gently drew</p>
				<p>His warm arms, thrilling now with pulses new,</p>
				<p>From their sweet thrall, and forward gently bending,</p>
				<p>Thank’d Heaven that his joy was never ending ;</p>
				<p>While ’gainst his forehead he devoutly press’d</p>
				<p>A hand Heaven made to succoiu- the distress’d ;</p>
				<p>A hand that from the world’s bleak promontory</p>
				<p>Had lifted Calidore for deeds of glory.</p>
				<p>Amid the pages, and the torches’ glare, There stood a knight, patting the flowing hair no Of his proud horse’s mane : he was withal A man of elegance, and stature tall: So that the waving of his plumes would be High as the berries of a wild ash-tree,</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-52"/>
				<p>Or as the winged cap of Mercury. His armour was so dexterously wrought In shape, that sure no living man had thought It hard, and heavy steel: but that indeed It was some glorious form, some splendid weed, In which a spirit new come from the skies 120</p>
				<p>Might live, and show itself to human eyes. ‘T is the far-fam’d, the brave Sir Gondibert, Said the good man to Calidore alert; While the young warrior with a step of grace Came up⁠—a courtly smile upon his face. And mailed hand held out, ready to greet The large-eyed wonder, and ambitious heat Of the aspiring boy ; who as he led Those smiling ladies, often turned his head To admire the visor arched so gracefully 130</p>
				<p>Over a knightly brow ; while they went by The lamps that from the high-roof d hall were pendent, And gave the steel a shining quite transcendent.</p>
				<p>Soon in a pleasant chamber they are seated ; The sweet-lipp’d ladies have already greeted All the green leaves that round the window clamber. To show their purple stars, and bells of amber. Sir Gondibert has doff’d his shining steel, Gladdening in the free, and airy feel Of a light mantle ; and while Clerimond 140</p>
				<p>Is looking round about him with a fond And placid eye, young Calidore is burning To hear of knightly deeds, and gallant spurning Of all unworthiness; and how the strong of arm Kept off dismay, and terror, and alarm From lovely woman; while brimful of this, He gave each damsel’s hand so warm a kiss, And had such manly ardour in his eye, That each at other look’d half-staringly ;</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-53"/>
				<p>And then their features started into smiles, 150</p>
				<p>Sweet as blue heavens o’er enchanted isles.</p>
				<p>Softly the breezes from the forest came, Softly they blew aside the taper’s flame ; Clear was the song from Philomel’s far bower ; Grateful the incense from the lime-tree flower; Mysterious, wild, the far heard trumpet’s tone ; Lovely the moon in ether, all alone: Sweet too the converse of these happy mortals, As that of busy spirits when the portals Are closing in the west; or that soft humming 160 We hear around when Hesperus is coming. Sweet be their sleep. …</p>

				<h3>Epistle to Charles Cowden Clarke</h3>
				<p>Oft have you seen a swan superbly frowning. And with proud breast his own white shadow</p>
				<p>crowning ; He slants his neck beneath the waters bright So silently, it seems a beam of light Come from the galaxy : anon he sports⁠—With outspread wings the Naiad Zephyr courts, Or ruffles all the surface of the lake In striving from its crystal face to take Some diamond water-drops, and them to treasure In milky nest, and sip them off at leisure. 10</p>
				<p>But not a moment can he there insure them, Nor to such downy rest can he allure them; For down they rush as though they would be free. And drop like hours into eternity. Just like that bird am I in loss of time. Whene’er I venture on the stream of rhyme ; With shatter’d boat, oar snapt, and canvas rent, I slowly sail, scarce knowing my intent;</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-54"/>
				<p>Still scooping up the water with my fingers,</p>
				<p>In which a trembling diamond never lingers. 20</p>
				<p>By this, friend Charles, you may full plainly see “Why I have never penn’d a line to thee: Because my thoughts were never free, and clear, And little fit to please a classic ear; Because my wine was of too poor a savour For one whose palate gladdens in the flavour Of sparkling Helicon :⁠—small good it were To take him to a desert rude, and bare, Who had on Baiae’s shore reclin’d at ease, “While Tasso’s page was floating in a breeze 30</p>
				<p>That gave soft music from Armida’s bowers, Mingled with fragrance from her rarest flowers : Small good to one who had by Mulla’s stream Fondled the maidens with the breasts of cream ; Who had beheld Belphoebe in a brook, And lovely Una in a leafy nook. And Archimago leaning o’er his book: Who had of all that’s sweet tasted, and seen, From silv’ry ripple, up to beauty’s queen ; From the sequester’d haunts of gay Titania, 40</p>
				<p>To the blue dwelling of divine Urania: One, who of late had ta’en sweet forest walks With him who elegantly chats and talks⁠—The wrong’d Libertas⁠—who has told you stories Of laurel chaplets, and Apollo’s glories ; Of troops chivalrous prancing through a city. And tearful ladies made for love, and pity: With many else which I have never known. Thus have I thought; and days on days have</p>
				<p>flown Slowly, or rapidly⁠—unwilling still 50</p>
				<p>For you to try my dull, unlearned quill. Nor should I now, but that I ‘ve known you long; That you first taught me all the sweets of song :</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-55"/>
				<p>The grand, the sweet, the terse, the free, the fine: What swell’d with pathos, and what right divine : Spenserian vowels that elope with ease. And float along like birds o’er summer seas : Miltonian storms, and more, Miltonian tenderness : Michael in arms, and more, meek Eve’s fair slender-</p>
				<p>ness. Who read for me the sonnet swelling loudly 60</p>
				<p>Up to its climax, and then dying proudly ? Who found for me the grandeur of the ode, Growing, like Atlas, stronger from its load ? Who let me taste that more than cordial dram. The sharp, the rapier-pointed epigram ? Show’d me that epic was of all the king, Round, vast, and spanning all, like Saturn’s ring ? You too upheld the veil from Clio’s beauty, And pointed out the patriot’s stern duty ; The might of Alfred, and the shaft of Tell ; 70</p>
				<p>The hand of Brutus, that so grandly fell Upon a tyrant’s head. Ah! had I never seen, Or known your kindness, what might I have been ? What my enjoyments in my youthful years, Bereft of all that now my life endears ? And can I e’er these benefits forget ? And can I e’er repay the friendly debt ? No, doubly no;⁠—yet should these rhymings</p>
				<p>please, I shall roll on the grass with twofold ease ; For I have long time been my fancy feeding 80</p>
				<p>With hopes that you would one day think the reading Ot my rough verses not an hour misspent; Should it e’er be so, what a rich content! Some weeks have pass’d since last I saw the spires In lucent Thames reflected:⁠—warm desires To see the sun o’er-peep the eastern dimness And morning shadows streaking into slimness,</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-56"/>
				<p>Across the lawny fields, and pebbly water;</p>
				<p>To mark the time as they grow broad, and shorter ;</p>
				<p>To feel the air that plays about the hills, 90</p>
				<p>And sips its freshness from the little rills;</p>
				<p>To see high, golden corn wave in the light</p>
				<p>When Cynthia smiles upon a summer’s night,</p>
				<p>And peers among the cloudlet’s jet and white.</p>
				<p>As though she were reclining in a bed</p>
				<p>Of bean blossoms, in heaven freshly shed.</p>
				<p>No sooner had I stepp’d into these pleasures.</p>
				<p>Than I began to think of rhymes and measures ;</p>
				<p>The air that floated by me seem’d to say</p>
				<p>‘Write ! thou wilt never have a better day.’ 100</p>
				<p>And so I did. When many lines I ‘d written.</p>
				<p>Though with their grace I was not oversmitten,</p>
				<p>Yet, as my hand was warm, I thought I ‘d better</p>
				<p>Trust to my feelings, and write you a letter.</p>
				<p>Such an attempt required an inspiration</p>
				<p>Of a peculiar sort⁠—a consummation ;⁠—</p>
				<p>Which, had I felt, these scribblings might have</p>
				<p>been Verses from which the soul would never wean ; But many days have past since last my heart Was warm’d luxuriously by divine Mozart; no</p>
				<p>By Arne delighted, or by Handel madden’d ; Or by the song of Erin pierc’d and sadden’d : What time you were before the music sitting, And the rich notes to each sensation fitting. Since I have walk’d with you through shady lanes That freshly terminate in open plains. And revell’d in a chat that ceased not When at night-fall among your books we got: No, nor when supper came, nor after that⁠—Nor when reluctantly I took my hat; 120</p>
				<p>No, nor till cordially you shook my hand Mid-way between our homes :⁠—your accents bland Still sounded in my ears, when I no- more Could hear your footsteps touch the grav’ly floor.</p>
				<div class="newpage" id="page-57"/>
				<p>Sometimes I lost them, and then found again ; You changed the foot-path for the grassy plain. In those still moments I have wish’d you joys That well you know to honour :⁠—‘ Life’s very toys With him,’ said I, ‘will take a pleasant charm ; It cannot be that ought will work him harm.’ 130 These thoughts now come o’er me with all their</p>
				<p>might:⁠—Again I shake your hand⁠—friend Charles, good</p>
				<p>night.</p>

				<h3>On a Picture of Leander</h3>
				<p>Come hither, all sweet maidens soberly, Down-looking aye, and with a chasten’d light Hid in the fringes of your eyelids white,</p>
				<p>And meekly let your fair hands joined be,</p>
				<p>As if so gentle that ye could not see, Untouch’d, a victim of your beauty bright, Sinking away to his young spirit’s night,</p>
				<p>Sinking bewilder’d ‘mid the dreary sea:</p>
				<p>‘T is young Leander toiling to his death ; Nigh swooning, he doth purse his weary lips</p>
				<p>For Hero’s cheek, and smiles against her smile. O hoiTid dream ! see how his body dips Dead-heavy ; arms and shoulders gleam awhile;</p>
				<p>He’s gone ; up bubbles all his amorous breath !</p>

				<p>When I have fears that I may cease to be</p>

				<p>Their shadows, with the magic hand of chance And when I feel, fair creature of an hour !</p>

Lend thine ear To a young Delian oath⁠—ay, by thy soul. By all that from thy mortal lips did roll. And by the kernel of thine earthly love. Beauty, in things on earth, and things above, I swear ! When every childish fashion</p>
				<p>Has vanish’d from my rhyme, Will I, grey-gone in passion. Leave to an after-time, Hymning and harmony Of thee, and of thy works, and of thy life; But vain is now the burning and the strife, Pangs are in vain, until I grow high-rife</p>
				<p>With old Philosophy, And mad with glimpses of futurity !</p>
				<p>For many years my offering must be hush’d ;</p>
				<p>When I do speak, I ’11 think upon this hour, Because I feel my forehead hot and flush’d. Even at the simplest vassal of thy power⁠—A lock of thy bright hair⁠—Sudden it came. And I was startled, when I caught thy name</p>
				<p>Coupled so unaware ; Yet, at the moment, temperate was my blood. I thought I had beheld it from the flood.</p>

				<p>TO A FRIEND</p>
				<p>No! those days are gone away, And their hours are old and gray, And their minutes buried all Under the down-trodden pall Of the leaves of many years: Many times have Winter’s shears, Frozen North, and chilling East, Sounded tempests to the feast Of the forest’s whispering fleeces, Since men knew nor rent nor leases.</p>
				<p>No, the bugle sounds no more, And the twanging bow no more ; Silent is the ivory shrill Past the heath and up the hill; There is no mid-for est laugh. Where lone Echo gives the half To some wight, amaz’d to hear Jesting, deep in forest drear.</p>

				<p>For he left the merry tale. Messenger for spicy ale.</p>
				<p>Gone, the merry morris din ; Gone, the song of Gamelyn ; Gone, the tough-belted outlaw Idling in the ‘ grene shawe ;’ All are gone away and past! And if Robin should be cast Sudden from his turfed grave, And if Marian should have 40</p>
				<p>Once again her forest days. She would weep, and he would craze: He would swear, for all his oaks, Fall’n beneath the dock-yard strokes. Have rotted on the briny seas ; She would weep that her wild bees Sang not to her⁠—strange ! that honey Can’t be got without hard money!</p>
				<p>So it is ; yet let us sing Honour to the old bow-string ! 50</p>

O thou, whose only book has been the light Of supreme darkness which thou feddest on Night after night when Phoebus was away, To thee the Spring shall be a triple morn.
