			<h2 epub:type="title">To Autumn</h2>
			<h3 id="to-autumn-1" epub:type="z3998:roman">I</h3>
			<p>
				<span>Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Conspiring with him how to load and bless</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eaves run;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To bend with apples the moss’d cottage-trees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And still more, later flowers for the bees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until they think warm days will never cease,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">For Summer has o’er-brimm’d their clammy cells.</span>
			</p>
			<h3 id="to-autumn-2" epub:type="z3998:roman">II</h3>
			<p>
				<span>Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thee sitting careless on a granary floor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or on a half-reap’d furrow sound asleep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Drowsed with the fume of poppies, while thy hook</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Steady thy laden head across a brook;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or by a cider-press, with patient look,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Thou watchest the last oozings, hours by hours.</span>
			</p>
			<h3 id="to-autumn-3" epub:type="z3998:roman">III</h3>
			<p>
				<span>Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Among the river-sallows, borne aloft</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The redbreast whistles from a garden-croft,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.</span>
